Chapter 26
--------
{: .-three-column}


### #1 (Chapter 26)

 With only a few exceptions, you human beings of Earth have fallen prey to a boundless and fateful erroneous assumption, because you assume that your belief in godheads and tin gods as well as in idolised human beings
is the truth of all truth, and that the truth is dependent on you according to whether you believe in it or not.

### #2 (Chapter 26)

 Know, however, that the truth does not need to run after you and impose itself upon you, because truthly the
 necessity lies with you for you to search for the truth and for you betake yourselves to the truth so that you
 may understand it and become knowing about it.

### #3 (Chapter 26)

 However, because you do not find the truth alone, because you are guided into the unreal through your belief
 in gods, tin gods, idolised human being as well as through religions, ideologies and philosophies, proclaimers
 of the truth have, on their own initiative, sent themselves out to you in order to teach and admonish you, so
 that you refrain from all of your belief and you turn solely to the truth of the Creation and its laws and recom-
 mendations, in which you are just as much able to find the truth as in yourselves.

### #4 (Chapter 26)

 However, in spite of the proclaimers of the truth teaching you through the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› and
 bringing you the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, you laugh at them and expose them to ridicule.

### #5 (Chapter 26)

 You disregard the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and you drag it down
 into the realm of your unintellect and your irrationality, and through your thoughts and feelings you create a
 devaluation of the truth itself, as well as of the Creation and of its laws and recommendations, which is, how-
 ever, an characterlessness beyond compare.

### #6 (Chapter 26)

 Truly, your wrong thoughts and feelings and your equally wrong understanding wreak not only great harm in yourselves but also in your fellow human beings and indeed amongst all of you, you human beings of Earth.

### #7 (Chapter 26)

 It is particularly through the attitude of your priests and theologians, preachers and sect leaders as well as ideo-
 logues and philosophers that you are held away from the real truth and coerced to the belief in their irrational
 teachings, because they falsely present you the illusion that the religious, sectarian, ideological or philosophical
 belief is the real truth of all truth; through that, they are wanting to proselytise you to their own belief and to
 win you over to this through conviction.

### #8 (Chapter 26)

 However, all of this does not contribute to you finding the effective truth which is given alone through the
 Creation and its laws and recommendations, in fact quite the opposite it leads you away from the truth and
 from the Creation and immoderately increases in you the already pronounced conceit and delusion of your
 own importance, through which you are put into the delusion that you should have to be asked to do good
 and to become truthly human beings in humaneness; this is an overbearingness beyond compare from you,
 because you yourselves must strive without being requested to do good, to become true human beings in
 humaneness and to behave also as such towards all the created creations and everything else that exists.

### #9 (Chapter 26)

 However, truly, with your belief and with your peculiar attitude, you are in the bulk of the humankind still far
 from the being human in the real and true sense and far from the humaneness, because in your belief in god-
 heads, tin gods and idolised human beings you are as examples exceedingly deterring ones.

### #10 (Chapter 26)

 Numbering in the thousand millions, you feel yourselves great and strong and you live in an overbearing satis- faction with regard to the fact that you are believers in gods, tin gods or human beings and you beseechingly
offer wretchedly submissive prayers to them, through which you present yourselves the illusion to have an ele-
vated state of your consciousness as well as of your thoughts and feelings, whereas however you are doing
unright, evil, unrighteous, irresponsible, criminal, unfair and conscienceless things, and you are indulging in
hatred and jealousy, pathological craving for revenge and pathological craving for retaliation as well as in strife,
war, torture, lies, cheating, calumny, theft and whatever else there is that is of the terribleness, of the Aus-
artung and of the depravity; in so doing, you truly do not realise that in your belief you are doing things which can never be reconciled with the true love and with the truth of all truth and therefore also not with the laws and recommendations of the Creation.

### #11 (Chapter 26)

 It is in the consciousness-based elevated state brought about through the belief and in all the evil that you do
 as a result that you feel in yourselves a satisfaction which you for your obedience erroneously interpret as
 thanks to your god, tin god or idolised human being, thereby imagining a connection with it or him; and not
 rarely do you thereby imagine in yourselves also a feeling of happiness and feeling of joy when, in your belief-
 delusion, you sink into a submissive trembling.

### #12 (Chapter 26)

 Human beings of Earth, you are manifold throngs of believers of different religions, sects, ideologies and philo-
 sophies as well as of all kinds of political orientations which are wrong beyond compare and are far from the
 effective truth and rightness.

### #13 (Chapter 26)

 Through your belief-edifices, you live blindly in a false, imaginary reality, and in your self-created delusion, you
 believe that you live in love and happiness.

### #14 (Chapter 26)

 Very many amongst you, you human beings of Earth, with regard to your belief and its exercise, are bigots,
 fanatics and other zealots, hypocrites, boasters and deceivers as well as slanderers, haughty fools, swaggerers
 and megalomaniacs, which you entirely also carry over into your inner and outer life, thereby creating hatred
 and jealousy, unpeace, unfreedom, torture, war, death penalty, disharmony, criminality and all evil, terrible
 things and Ausartungen in the world.

### #15 (Chapter 26)

 You harbour false thanks in your thoughts and feelings, and in your irrational belief you indulge in giving
 thanks to your god or tin god in imperiousness for not being like the others, through which you want to make
 yourselves better than you are, whereby you raise yourselves up megalomaniacally over your fellow human
 beings, despite the fact that you are no more and no better than them, namely fallible human beings who
 must first strive for the truth and must understand it in order to become true, responsible, conscientious and
 righteous human beings through the following of the truth.

### #16 (Chapter 26)

 In many cases, you do not speak what you think, rather you lie to your fellow human beings, hypocritically
 feigning love and inclination, although you find them unsympathetic and despise them, and the many amongst
 you who do this, you are cowardly against the truth, because you do not dare to pronounce it and you fear
 that your prestige might suffer setbacks and material loss if you speak the truth.

### #17 (Chapter 26)

 And when you lie or thank your god or tin god, then you are thereby creating thoughts for yourselves through
 which uplifting feelings arise, whereas in fact in your deeper inner, in your inner nature, nothing else but a
 gaping void prevails.

### #18 (Chapter 26)

 Your feeling-based elevated state is, as a rule, nothing more than a wanted reaction of your thoughts in order
 to create a gratification for yourselves.

### #19 (Chapter 26)

 And those amongst you who bow down in submissiveness before your god or tin god or before an idolised
 human being, kneeling down or casting yourselves into the dust before it or him, you are in reality very far from
 having esteem for yourselves and for the real truth.

### #20 (Chapter 26)

 In your submissiveness, you will never find yourselves nor the truth, because your inner self and the truth do
 not demand submissiveness, but rather esteem, courage, dignity and venerability.

### #21 (Chapter 26)

 You do not achieve a true inner condition of the real truth, of the true love, freedom and harmony, peace and
 upright delightedness through submissiveness, and indeed not even if you believe that you will already certainly
 have them.

### #22 (Chapter 26)

 Liberate yourselves from each form of the submissiveness, from the being doggish and from the dignityless
 subjugation, and see that you do not lose yourselves in your imperiousness, in the megalomania and haughti-
 ness, which you wrongly believe to be esteem, courage and dignity.

### #23 (Chapter 26)

 All of those amongst you who are without any religious, sectarian, ideological, political or philosophical belief
 and are without submissiveness, you will find it very much easier to search for the truthly truth and to study it
 carefully than those who have fallen prey to any belief whatsoever; truly, many amongst you have however
 fallen prey to the conceited submissiveness, through which you do not see the reality and therefore doggish-
 submissively ask your invented god, tin god or idolised human being for help, although you must help your-
 selves in every wise.

### #24 (Chapter 26)

 You cannot stand before a god, tin god or idolised human being in order for it or him to reward you for your
 beseeching, doggish-submissive requests, prayers and sanctimonious words, because they are powerless and
 only hazy forms of your delusion.

### #25 (Chapter 26)

 Your beseeching requests and prayers are only cowardly demands, because in your belief you cannot bring
 forth the esteem, courage and dignity to help yourselves in every respect and wise; however, this corresponds
 to a hypocrisy, since through your beseeching requests and prayers to a god, tin god, to saints, angels or an
 idolised human being you are chickenheartedly concealing your own incapability.

### #26 (Chapter 26)

 And as you conceal your own incapability, you also deny the truth in the same form, the truth that is given through the Creation in its laws and recommendations; and through your lying and rejection of the truth, every-
thing is whirling wildly around in your thoughts and feelings like empty chaff that is devoid of the valueful grain.

### #27 (Chapter 26)

 Your own incapability is built up on a wrong, silent and submissive expectation with regard to something bet-
 ter, that shall be given to you by your godhead, your tin god or idolised human being, your saint or angel, and
 this expectation is in reality nothing other than a selfish, brazen and hypocritical demanding arising from out
 of your cowardice; and it is chickenheartedness, even if everything is expressed in such beautiful and beseech-
 ing words, which prove that you yourselves are not great and powerful enough to liberate yourselves from the
 believing and connect yourselves with the effective truth, in order to help yourselves out of it.

### #28 (Chapter 26)

 And those amongst you human beings of Earth who are hypocrites, the reward therefor will be certain, but
 quite different than you think, because due to the fact that you satiate yourselves with your hypocrisy, disad-
 vantage will be given to you in your consciousness-evolution, and indeed in the same measure as the unvalue
 that you yourselves create.

### #29 (Chapter 26)

 Your wellfeeling in your hypocrisy, however, also passes from you if you are shunned through your fellow human
 beings for your wrong doing, so your thoughts and feelings cause you certain pains and your conscience stirs
 in a disagreeable wise.

### #30 (Chapter 26)

 Each of your hypocritical demands is an overbearingness beyond compare which you can never vindicate if you
 in truth guide your life according to the truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations.

### #31 (Chapter 26)

 You shall not ask and not beseech, but rather give enough consideration to the truth by mobilising in yourselves your energies and their powers and help yourselves according to the best of your ability in all conceivable
things of the consciousness-evolution, which is exceedingly extensive and has very many things inherent in it.

### #32 (Chapter 26)

 You shall only request external, material help in modesty from your fellow human beings, because only in this
 wise can you expect help, whereas with regard to your evolutive consciousness-concerns as well as your inner
 nature, your individuality, your character and your personality, you can help yourselves only alone, because only
 you alone are able to change and evolve yourselves in these things.

### #33 (Chapter 26)

 Even the true prophets who come to you are unable to change you, because you can really only do this alone
 for yourselves, hence they only bring you the teaching of what you shall do in order to call forth a develop-
 mental change to the good and best in yourselves; and the proclaimers of the truth do not entreat you and
 do not demand anything from you either, because they merely bring the message of the truth in a neutral wise
 and warn so that you yourselves may work on yourselves in order to give enough consideration to the truth
 of the life and to guide your existence in love, fairness, in peace, freedom, conscientiousness, harmony, right-
 eousness and responsibility.

### #34 (Chapter 26)

 The proclaimers of the truth, the true prophets, they only give you explanations with regard to the truth and
 sign-postings for your life-conduct, in return for which they are not thinking about enticing rewards for them-
 selves; and as they themselves do not demand any reward for their teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit,
 teaching of the life that they bring, therefore they do not either promise you any enticing rewards if you turn
 to the real truth and to the true life according to the creational laws and recommendations; you must give your-
 selves any reward for your endeavours through building up in yourselves a general mental as well as feeling-
 based and thereout psychical and consciousness-based wellbeing, in true love, freedom and harmony as well
 as in inner peace – therefore go forth and act accordingly, you human beings of Earth.

### #35 (Chapter 26)

 With your demanding, you are always standing before yourselves, when you enticingly beseech, entreat and
 pray, as you also stand only before yourselves with your complaints and sorrows, because you must also arrange,
 reconcile and master these things with yourselves and in yourselves; truly, there is in fact no god or tin god as
 well as also no idolised or other human being who can take away your complaints and sorrows and master
 them for you, because you can at all times only in yourselves and alone master and overcome everything.

### #36 (Chapter 26)

 Truly, when those amongst you, human beings of Earth, you who in your belief in a godhead, a tin god, idolised
 or other human being continue to place demands in hypocrisy, instead of carefully studying the truth and guid -
 ing your lives accordingly, then – in your badness and in your vacillation – you remain lying in the gloom of
 your truth-unknowledgeness, and you cannot dedicate yourselves to the upwards striving to the true life and
 being human in the real and true sense; truthly, in this wise you are continuously exposed to the attacks out
 of the darkness of the truth-unknowledge, through which you cannot come to realise your erroneous assump-
 tion of your belief in a godhead, a tin god, saints, angels or an idolised human being, and you cannot free
 yourselves from the false religions, ideologies and philosophies.
