{: .-three-column}



### #1 (Chapter 28)

 How often do you human beings of Earth make yourselves wrong pictures of words, because you do not understand them in their actual term and value, as is the case, for example, with the word truth which you push into the abyss of your belief in a god, a tin god or a human being whom you high-stylize to an idol. (high-stylize = to make someone/something appear to be more important or better than he/she/it in reality is, or to make someone/something appear to be something that he/she/it in reality is not).
 

### #2 (Chapter 28)

 You search for the truth in a religious, ideological or philosophical belief and do not understand the falseness of the belief which has nothing whatsoever to do with the truth which alone is given in the certainty in recognition of the reality.
 

### #3 (Chapter 28)

 If you search for the truth without imposing any requirements, then you will find it only in the certainty in
 recognition of the reality, because only what corresponds to the reality is truth, but never a belief of any
 fashion, because it is in every wise always unreal, unsubstantial and unprovable, in contrariety to the effective
 truth which is based on provable reality.

### #4 (Chapter 28)

 But you human beings of Earth, you live in complete confusion, far from the truth of the Creation and its laws
 and recommendations, hanging onto false belief-forms in your thoughts, wherethrough you glorify invented
 godheads, tin gods and human beings as idols.

### #5 (Chapter 28)

 And you understand neither pictures of the term spiritual, nor the spirituality, nor the picture of the term spirit- form, so you do not know that these pictures and terms are not identical with your consciousness, the evolution
of which you should be consciously integrated into, which you however do not understand; nor do you under-
stand that you bring forth your ideas as well as your thoughts and the thereout resulting feelings through the
consciousness and not through the spirit, i.e. the spirit-form that animates you; your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form
that animates you is of purely creational-energetical nature and is only given to you to animate your conscious-
ness and your body, whereas your material consciousness alone is that factor out of which you create your ideas
and thoughts etc., which on the contrary is not possible for your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form; the spirit in you only
integrates into itself the essence of the knowledge, i.e. the wisdom created out of your consciousness and evolves
with it, whereas the consciousness evolves automatically through its activity of the researching and learning.

### #6 (Chapter 28)

 But you do not understand these things and live in complete confusion because of the false teachings of the
 religions, ideologies and philosophies, and this confusion shows itself in everything that you bring about
 through your consciousness in terms of your ideas and thoughts and the feelings resulting out of them, as
 however also in all your activity and deeds.

### #7 (Chapter 28)

 In your confusion, you want to make the real truth to your helpful slave which shall only serve for the benefit
 of you small-knowing human beings of Earth, and bring you rescue when in hardship, although you have no
 idea what the truth really is and that it only exists in the certainty in recognition of the reality, but not in any
 belief as you assume in your evil erroneous assumption.

### #8 (Chapter 28)

 And the rescue which shall be brought to you through the truth, you make yourselves a wrong picture of this,
 which is why you expect requirementless help from it and in so doing you exclude everything that belongs to
 the truth, such as the absolute reality and everything that is included therein such as the fairness, the true love,
 the peace, the freedom and harmony, the righteousness, responsibility, conscientiousness and what is fair.

### #9 (Chapter 28)

 Search in the words and terms for the true pictures, i.e. the true contents and think for once about yourselves
 thoroughly, and illuminate and fathom your thoughts and feelings clearly and factually without self-glossing
 over in order to get to the true bottom of them and to recognise and understand them; and if you do that,
 then you will have to realise that your entire thought- and feeling-world has never been based on anything
 else other than demanding wish-fulfilments as well as help and rescue which you expect from your fabulated
 godheads, tin gods and idolised human beings.

### #10 (Chapter 28)

 Of course, you do not call your demands on your godheads, tin gods and idolised human beings for help, rescue
 and wishes by its true name, namely doggish-submissive and beseeching begging, as this corresponds to the
 kind of your miseducated and misdriven inner nature, instead you describe your wrong volition and subservient
 begging as prayers and devotion in belief.

### #11 (Chapter 28)

 You put on a small cloak of the mendaciousness and at the same time of the submissive servitude, in so doing
 you deny yourselves and also fall into hypocrisy, so that nothing good and sincere results out of this, because
 everything that you practise in your whole doing, even during your self-humiliating prayers and beggings to
 your godhead, your tin god or your idolised human being, is full of unhonesty and full of terrible things.

### #12 (Chapter 28)

 And all of you amongst you human beings of Earth who go forth full of unfairness, truth-unknowledgeness,
 therefor however full of belief in religions, ideologies or philosophies, be finally true and honest towards your-
 selves, and indeed so deep-reachingly that you tremble at the recognition of what you have done throughout
 your life that was wrong and against truth and because of that have led a life of the ignominy.

### #13 (Chapter 28)

 All those amongst you who are overbearing, self-willed and unsatisfied in your belief, you are also hypocritical and superficial, and if affliction and hardship strike you, you wallow in self-pity and hope for the help from
others, whereas you yourselves are without any real feelings for others when others are struck by affliction and
hardship, because you think in the frame of your own skin being the closest to you and that the others shall help themselves.

### #14 (Chapter 28)

 Those amongst you human beings of Earth who are overbearing, self-willed and unsatisfied, you should ask
 yourselves what kind of human beings you are in the presence of the all-mightiness, sublimity and harmony of
 the Creation which activates and directs for you so that you have everything that you need for life and that
 you can use as you like, which you however, in your overbearingness and boastfulness, entirely take and use
 as an implicitness and without gratitude.

### #15 (Chapter 28)

 You live in an unbelievably megalomaniacal conceitedness and believe that you could create peace, freedom
 and harmony amongst your humankind with the enforcement of your illogical and, with regard to the life,
 strange laws and ordinances that are made through your illogical kind of thinking; but your laws and ordinances
 are not in consonance with the creational laws and recommendations and therefore bring, instead of love,
 regulation, peace, freedom and harmony, only coercion, unfreedom, hatred, unpeace and disharmony.

### #16 (Chapter 28)

 You do not try to obtain your volition for love, peace, freedom and harmony through the truth of the creational
 laws and recommendations, not through intellect and rationality, and not through true discernment and logic,
 but instead through a wrong volition in irresponsible cleverness and pathological-dumb mode of thinking;
 through this you look to gain advantages for yourselves with regard to positions, estimation, titles, goods and
 chattels and riches and to achieve this you do everything and do not realise that in doing so you bring only
 disadvantage to yourselves as well as to your next one and fellow human being and even to your whole
 humankind.

### #17 (Chapter 28)

 Everything weighs on you like a heavy burden which you carry due to your own guilt and which you cannot
 put down, as it also cannot be solved and abrogated through the law of the interaction because of your wrong
 doing, unless you turn to the real truth and through it are able to free yourselves therefrom by changing your-
 selves in your volition, and indeed to the good, the best and the right.

### #18 (Chapter 28)

 Only if you change to the good, best and right and direct yourselves at this in upright volition, will you be saved
 from a fall into even deeper abysses than the ones into which you have already fallen; only through your honest
 volition and endeavour can you tear away the impeding hindrances in you which have already for so long and
 so far unstoppably been crushing down upon you with all evil, and which have been letting you persist in con-
 sciousness-indolence and conceitedness, wherethrough you have up to now been persisting in the reflecting
 on the evil which is far away from the truth and far from all the creational laws and recommendations.

### #19 (Chapter 28)

 Put an end to your knowledge-darkness and let the evil, the unright, the unfairness and unrighteousness as well as the consciencelessness and irresponsibility break down in you, and let the true love, harmony, freedom
as well as the peace become truth in you and in your whole humankind so that you learn to live the true life
in order to end your wars, your hatred and your jealousy as well as your crimes and all the other terrible things.

### #20 (Chapter 28)

 Let all the terrible things on your world and in you break down and swing the word of the true love and the
 real truth in you and amongst all human beings upwards, so that it becomes victorious and resounds through
 the whole world and that all can hear it, learn out of it and live according to it.

### #21 (Chapter 28)

 Consider however the requirement, that every one amongst you human beings of Earth must make his or her
 own efforts to recognise the truth and follow it, because only then, when every single one of you changes
 developmentally, can everything spread over the whole humankind and make it into a truthful oneness from
 out of which all the terrible things – through which you have been living, since time immemorial, in wars and
 hatred, in jealousy, unpeace, unfreedom, crime, terror as well as in disharmony and many other terrible things –
 are jointly fought against and resolved..

### #22 (Chapter 28)

 Do not doubtingly let the possibility pass you by to change everything to the good, the best and right by fol-
 lowing the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, that is to say the ‹Teaching
 of the Prophets›, the ‹Goblet of the Truth›.

### #23 (Chapter 28)

 However, if you do not bring forward the energy and power and the intellect and the rationality in yourselves
 to follow the teaching, then everything that you undertake for the love, freedom and harmony as well as for
 the peace will be to no avail to you, because you will continue to do the wrong things and bring upon your
 world and yourselves war, hatred, terror, overpopulation and every conceivable terrible thing, because, due to
 your unintellect and your irrationality, you will never be in the situation of understanding that moment through
 which you can find the way to the truthly progress as well as to the true love and love for the next one, to the
 freedom, harmony and to the peace.

### #24 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, your rescue lies in the following of the truth in accordance with the creational laws and recommendations,
 therefore you must accept the word of the truth and the truth itself in order to free yourselves from the bonds
 of the evil which hold you down in misconception and falsification of the real truth.

### #25 (Chapter 28)

 Since time immemorial, you have been poisoned through false teachings of false prophets and endangered through wrong explanations of the truth which you have made in falsifications into religions, ideologies and
philosophies and into belief-cults of godheads, tin gods, and idolised human beings; in doing so, however, you
have also disfigured up to the point of unrecognisability all freshness, all energy and power as well as all clarity of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and enwrapped them with lies and with damage-bringing calumnies while creating wrong and religious, ideological and philosophical belief- forms and cults out of them, through which you have fallen into a consciousness-indolence, wherethrough you continue to run further and further into depravity until you find the real truth and hence the creational laws and recommendations and follow these.

### #26 (Chapter 28)

 So beware of the depravity-bringing false irrational teachings of the religions, ideologies and philosophies,
 because through them, you will be led only into a seducing slumber of the untruth, deception and the guidance
 into the unreal, which ultimately turns into the deep sleep of the depravity out of which you will no longer be
 able to awaken during the time of your life.

### #27 (Chapter 28)

 Consider that no true love lies in what the religions, sects, ideologies and philosophies teach you with regard
 to the indulgence and all-forgiving goodness of the invented godheads, tin gods and idolised human beings;
 instead the whole thing is falseness and a deluding drug for you which only forces the alertness of your cons-
 ciousness into tiredness and weakens it, so that in the end it wanes and forces upon you a belief out of which
 you can hardly free yourselves in good time once you have been befallen by it.

### #28 (Chapter 28)

 Only your sharp rationality and your clear intellect can get through the tiredness of the delusion and open the
 way to the real truth as well as to the true love which leads you to your inner way of the truth which is itself
 the truth and the culmination-point.

### #29 (Chapter 28)

 Pure rationality and clear intellect know no extenuations, no lies and no calumnies, just as they also know no
 excuse for pretences, such as are practised through the religious, ideological and philosophical belief; and for
 this reason, you human beings of Earth, you who are only too fond of pretending something to yourselves or
 let something be pretended to you through a belief, you are ruthless against yourselves and in reality hurt your-
 selves very heavily there, where in you the intellect and the rationality to the truth-finding are not functioning
 correctly.

### #30 (Chapter 28)

 The weakness in which you are caught through your religious, ideological, sectarian or philosophical belief
 brings great disadvantage to you as individuals and to the whole humankind, because in this weakness you
 assume that one day you will be judged through something higher, through a god or a tin god in some kind
 of fairness, which has already for a long time become strange to you through yourselves, because you have,
 as a result of your belief, moved away from the truth; and therefore you have lost the truth that not a godhead,
 a tin god or an idolised human being can give you fairness, but only you yourselves.

### #31 (Chapter 28)

 Only the strength of the character and of all the virtues through the Creation and its laws and recommenda-
 tions is unchangeable, and this strength of the character and of all the virtues you cannot find by an imaginary
 god, tin god or a human being that you raise to an idol, but only in yourselves by turning to the real truth of
 all truth and following it in the wise as is pre-given through the creational laws and recommendations; and this
 true strength of the character and of all the virtues of creational kind is independent of any human opinion;
 and it is free of favour and partiality, of might, malice, revenge, hatred and retribution.

### #32 (Chapter 28)

 If you do not use all your energy and power to free yourselves from the old and false and from your belief in
 a godhead, a tin god or an idolised human being, then you will not be able to learn to understand the true
 fairness which is as present in the core of your inner nature as is the true love and the truthly truth; and if you
 do not recognise in the core of your inner nature the true love, truth and fairness, then you will also not be
 able to become new in your self, because only if you stand with the whole truth in the life and consciously strive
 for the evolution of your consciousness does the help arise from out of yourselves that you need to lead your
 life in accordance with the creational laws and recommendations as well as in true love, freedom, harmony
 and in peace.

### #33 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, every single one amongst you, you human beings of Earth, must help himself or herself through the
 recognition and following of the truth, which alone shows you the true way of the life that you have to go;
 and only on this way do you find the true existence which will not be given to you, if you do not tread this
 way.

### #34 (Chapter 28)

 Human beings of Earth, you must become strong in the fight of the gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit for the truthly
 truth, because you must lead this fight yourselves, each one of you for himself or herself alone – or you will
 go under.

### #35 (Chapter 28)

 Finally wake up and stand up in the fight of the gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit against all evil and all darkness
 in you, because only through doing that do you create the necessary energy and power in your inner to find
 and follow the real truth, as it is given through the creational laws and recommendations; but if you are weak-
 lings, and you continue to cling to your belief in godheads, tin gods, angels, saints and idolised human beings,
 then the true life will be lost to you as well as all the energy and power it possesses.

### #36 (Chapter 28)

 If you are weaklings and dependent on belief-forms, then you will not be able to find the effective truth, and those few things that you may perhaps find from it, you will not know how to use rightly; and furthermore, it
 will be taken away again from you through your belief to which you are devoted in anxiety and fear and because
 you are too cowardly to free yourselves from it; as a result you use your energy and power for your belief-
 driven zeal in an incorrect wise through which the ancient word comes true that belief is a drug from which
 the human being can hardly free himself or herself once he or she has fallen for it.

### #37 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, instead of building temples in order therein to wrongly pray to fabulated gods and tin gods and to spread
 false teachings of false teachers, you should build places of the truth in which only the real truth of all truth is
 taught, the truth of the Creation, its laws and recommendations and their effects; and instead of belief-events
 and prayer-events, you should do events and festivities during which the truth about the Creation and its laws
 and recommendations and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, the
 ‘Goblet of the Truth’ is taught, so that you human beings of Earth will become, as whole humankind, knowing
 and wise in the effective truth and that you follow the creational laws and recommendations in full responsi-
 bility-consciousness; and truly, while learning the truth and during events and festivities in favour of the truth
 and its learning, you can be full of joy and happiness and fulfil every conceivable responsibility.

### #38 (Chapter 28)

 Bearing the responsibility is always the first thing you have to do, but the by far largest number amongst you
 human beings of Earth, you push off the bearing and exercising of the responsibility onto your imaginary god-
 heads, tin gods, angels, saints and to idolised human beings as well as onto your next ones or other fellow
 human beings, because on the one hand you see the responsibility as a burden with which you do not want
 to encumber yourselves and, on the other hand, because the bearing of the responsibility is, out of cowardi-
 ce, too much for you, or because you think that you are not responsible yourselves.

### #39 (Chapter 28)

 But, the pushing off of the responsibility, no matter in what kind and wise it is done, corresponds to a self-
 degradation as well as to a cowardly submissiveness towards those who shall bear the responsibility; on the
 other hand, the pushing off of the responsibility is also a well-calculated consideration in the respect that with-
 out bearing and exercising one's own responsibility the life can be lived all the more joyfully, merrily and scru-
 plelessly.

### #40 (Chapter 28)

 So those of you amongst you human beings of Earth who want to satisfy all your desires and wishes, you think
 that you can obtain everything without the bearing of your own responsibility, as well as that you can behave
 negatively towards your next ones and fellow human beings in an irresponsible wise.

### #41 (Chapter 28)

 If need be, your human laws and ordinances can be circumvented and conflicts avoided, so many clever ones
 amongst you can, in the name of the laws and ordinances, successfully commit criminal deeds and other law-
 breaches etc., which do not stand up to moral examination, but nevertheless bear big names and titles and
 enjoy the reputation of an especially able and successful human being.

### #42 (Chapter 28)

 Thus many amongst you human beings of Earth are unrighteous ones who, despite your poor discernment,
 are able to live comfortably in accordance with your own views and your irresponsibility, and in your conscience-
 lessness no uneasy conscience pesters you and also no unrest is shown that your doing is not right and that
 you should do differently from what corresponds to your wishes and your behaviour.

### #43 (Chapter 28)

 The truth is that the reality of the life is inexorable, therefore your wishes in this respect cannot bring about
 any deviation from the reality, because the creational laws and recommendations remain brazenly existent, so
 that what you sow will as a rule be what you harvest; and this fact says more than you can conceive, because
 the whole corresponds exactly to the process of the interaction as it is given through the creational laws and
 recommendations.

### #44 (Chapter 28)

 The interaction is so precise that out of a cause a distinct effect is determinable in advance, and the effect
 always contains more than the cause initially carried in itself, just as from a single sowed corn a multiple in the
 form of an ear arises; therefore, you human beings of Earth, you will be struck in manifold forms by this again
 as effect of that which you create and send out as cause in your thoughts and feelings, and indeed according
 to the kind of your volition in a negative or positive wise.

### #45 (Chapter 28)

 Be conscious that in a consciousness-based wise and through your thoughts and feelings as well as through
 your deeds and your activity you bear the responsibility for everything, and this responsibility does not first
 begin when carrying out the action but already when the idea comes up and at the decision through the
 thoughts and feelings through which ultimately everything is transformed into the serious volition.

### #46 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, there is no splitting between the idea and its carrying out, if the idea is indeed realised, because
 everything belongs together and is a unity.

### #47 (Chapter 28)

 Everything always goes together, never just side by side, because the immenseness of the effects of the cre-
 ational laws and recommendations, which are invisible to you human beings of Earth, intertwine like a perfect
 and never failing machinery, even with regard to your ideas, thoughts, feelings, deeds and your activity in every
 respect.

### #48 (Chapter 28)

 And the laws and recommendations of the Creation, of the Universal Consciousness, are universally equal and
 so they also carry the whole in you and weave through every fibre of your body and your nerve cords and hold
 everything together, and everything is in mutual interaction and therefore functions perfectly.
 
### #49 (Chapter 28)

 Everything functions therefore according to the effects of the creational laws and recommendations which go
 through everything and without which no causes and no effects can occur; hence, if false teachings speak of
 heaven and hell and of god and devil, then this is fundamentally wrong, just as it is also wrong to talk of good
 and evil powers, because all energies and powers are neutral in their kind, so also the negative and the positive
 which only bring forth a distinct effect, when they are brought together; heaven and hell are not places but
 rather conditions in yourselves which you create yourselves through ideas, thoughts and feelings in your psyche,
 as are likewise the good and the evil which you also willingly put into action out of your ideas, thoughts, feel-
 ings and through your own decisions; therefore also your energies and powers are neutral in you human beings
 of Earth, in consequence you yourselves turn them into good or evil, and indeed through your ideas, thoughts
 and feelings as well as through your decisions and your volition; fundamentally, the negative and the positive
 are in themselves each a complete oneness, just as they result in a complete oneness when united in a right
 wise, but in a wrong union they create terribleness, as for example if you create evil out of your energies and
 powers through wrong ideas, thoughts and feelings as well as through a wrong volition.

### #50 (Chapter 28)

 There is only one negative that is complete in itself and one positive that is complete in itself, and through the
 uniting of both poles a complete oneness comes out once more and this oneness is Creation-given through
 the laws and recommendations as creational energy and power which constantly undulates through all the
 creational and is unseparably connected with the Creation and all its created creations and with everything that
 has come into existence through it.

### #51 (Chapter 28)

 The creational energy and the power resulting out of it can be found everywhere, in every drop of water, in the
 air, in the rocks and the stones, in every plant and in every life-form, so there is nothing in which the energy
 and its power does not exist.

### #52 (Chapter 28)

 And just as everything is flooded through by the creational energy and power, so also you human beings of
 Earth are continuously streamed through by it, as swinging waves out of the spirit-energy of the Creation,
 through which the life ignites in you and nourishes it.

### #53 (Chapter 28)

 Through your special constitution of your consciously working consciousness, you take in the instreaming neu-
 tral-positive-equalised creational energy and its power and pass it on through your ideas and thoughts as well
 as through the thereout resulting feelings, out of which then, according to your decisions and your volition,
 the activity arises, your actions and deeds; and depending on the kind of your ideas, thoughts and the there-
 with connected feelings as well as the thereout resulting decisions and the volition you automatically use the
 neutral-positive-equalised energy and its power out of your consciousness in a negative or positive, i.e. in an evil
 or good wise, therefore you use the energy and its power according to your own sense, and you yourselves
 fully decide what you in absolute self-responsibility want to do in the negative or positive, i.e. in the evil or good;
 this however is your greatest responsibility which you must bear with your own free will as human beings.

### #54 (Chapter 28)

 Those amongst you human beings of Earth who often crampingly search for the right way of the life, you shall
 not make it so hard for yourselves; instead look, in all uncomplicatedness, simply upon the creational energy
 and its power which flows through you and animates you and how you use it to create your ideas, thoughts
 and feelings which you form according to your own will and decision in the good or evil, for which you alone
 carry the responsibility; and if you look upon the animating creational energy and its powers, then you will find
 therein everything you have to know without great effort.

### #55 (Chapter 28)

 And if you look at the Creation-given energy and its power, then be conscious that it is only up to your thoughts
 and the thereout resulting feelings as well as up to your decision and will whether you want to bring forth
 good or evil through this immense and in itself neutral-positive-equalised energy and power; truly, it is through
 your decision that the good or evil is given to you only, depending on what furthering or ruin-bringing thoughts
 and feelings you form in yourselves and bring into effect.

### #56 (Chapter 28)

 Do not strain yourselves in order to cramp yourselves in belief-forms, belief-exercises and belief-cults of religious,
 ideological, philosophical, esoteric and other occult directions as well as through all possible and impossible
 physical exercises and consciousness-strains, because that brings you no true evolutive consciousness-improve-
 ment but only apparent successes of meaningless irrational teachings.

### #57 (Chapter 28)

 Give up all belief-forms of any kind, because they are only useless and time-consuming senselessnesses which
 time and again become a distressful torment and self-flagellation which bring absolutely no gain for you with
 regard to your consciousness-evolution and with regard to the recognition and responsible following of the
 creational laws and recommendations.

### #58 (Chapter 28)

 Your representatives, priests and other false teachers, false prophets and their students as well as the religion- ists, ideologues and philosophers, the sectarians, masters, sublime ones, godly ones and idolised human beings
etc. who preach to you the untruth with regard to all the godheads and tin gods, all of which are fabulated
imaginations, they are all modern sanctimonious ones in apparent bigotry, and indeed even then, if they present
the senselessnesses of their false religious, ideological or philosophical teachings in a deep belief, which can
 never be proven as truth because each belief is based on pure speculations and shows absolutely no concrete-
 ness of the reality.

### #59 (Chapter 28)

 Do not let yourselves be guided into the unreal through the false teachings which are irresponsibly preached
 by false prophets, by servants of gods and and servants of tin gods, but instead let yourselves go forth in pure
 joy of the recognition that you can, through your simple and good-wanting thoughts and feelings, direct and
 use effortlessly the neutral-positive-equalised, unique and immense energy and power given to you through
 the Creation to the best and to the good in the ample bearing of the responsibility; and according to your
 responsibility as well as your thoughts, feelings, your will and your decision, the energy and its power has an
 effect, so you only have to responsibly use and direct it in the right wise to the best and the good.

### #60 (Chapter 28)

 The use of the creational energy and power in you – through which you can use your consciousness and create
 ideas, thoughts and thereout feelings – happens in uncomplicatedness and simplicity, and for this, no religious,
 ideological or philosophical learning is required, so neither does it require a belief in a godhead, a tin god or
 an idolised human being nor in any esoteric and other occult nonsense; and truly to use the creational energy
 and power in you, you do not have to be able to read and write, but you only need your clear intellect and
 rationality to recognise the truth and, out of it, to use the Creation-given energy and power through which
 you are capable of having thoughts and feelings.

### #61 (Chapter 28)

 And truly, the creational energy and the power included therein is given to each of you human beings of Earth
 in equal measure and indeed without exception, thus no difference exists therein, because a difference is only
 given with regard to the level of the consciousness-evolution as well as concerning the degree of intellect and
 the rationality out of which also the fulfilment of the responsibility results.

### #62 (Chapter 28)

 The fulfilment of the responsibility is also connected with the perceiving of the reality of the creational laws
 and recommendations and their mode of functioning, wherein the perceiving of all things is also anchored,
 which does not happen through the consciousness directly but rather through the unconscious which comes
 before the consciousness and which is not identical with the subconsciousness; therefore each perception
 occurs through the unconscious-form which comes before the consciousness, through which immediately
 unconscious thoughts and thereout conscious feelings are triggered, after which, with a delay of 25-30 hun-
 dredth of a second, the consciousness and conscious thoughts themselves are included in the perception.

### #63 (Chapter 28)

 Just as you can also perceive the things of the reality, you are, if you are heedful and attentive enough, able
 to perceive the creational energy and its power in you through which you can, via your consciousness as well
 as your thoughts and feelings, achieve tremendous effects and direct the energy and power, and indeed in the
 good or evil, depending on how you willingly form and use everything in responsibility or irresponsibility.

### #64 (Chapter 28)

 If you use the creational energy and power that has been given you for the good and best in full responsibility,
 then you can be joyous over it and have a good self-feeling, whereas if you squander it uselessly or use it for the
 evil, then tremble, because through the interaction that is pre-given in the creational laws you cannot escape
 the disadvantage which you create for yourselves through the ungood; the power of the interaction always
 strikes you, both in the good when you use it rightfully, and in the evil when you misuse it, and truly you can-
 not hide from this.

### #65 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore the good is just as brought forth in you through the pure neutral-positive-equalised creational energy
 and power as is the evil, and indeed depending on how you form them and bring them into effect according
 to your own choosing and will.

### #66 (Chapter 28)

 You are free in the use of the creational energy and its power, so you can form and bring it into effect accord-
 ing to your own choosing and will, but this also includes the responsibility which you have to bear and from
 which you can never escape; consequently, you shall use everything in the good and positive, so that you can
 bear the full responsibility for your ideas, thoughts, feelings and deeds as well as for all your activity in every
 respect; also you are recommended to nourish and cherish your thought-world and your thereout resulting
 feelings in love and let peace, freedom and harmony prevail in you in order to also carry forth everything to
 your next ones, your fellow human beings and your whole humankind.

### #67 (Chapter 28)

 Also you amongst you human beings of Earth who live far from the effective truth and who are truth-unknowers,
 unfair ones, conscienceless ones, unrighteous ones, and irresponsible ones and who ignore the creational laws
 and recommendations, you can rejoice, because the same creational energy and power is given you as is given
 the fair ones, the righteous ones, the responsible ones and the conscientious ones who are strong in their
 truth-knowledge and who, contrary to you, follow the Creation-given laws and recommendations.

### #68 (Chapter 28)

 You only need to use the creational energy and power in you, refrain from making everything heavy for your-
 selves and not forget that everything creational streams through you too and that you are capable of giving
 everything a distinct direction according to your own volition and will, thus in the good and in the evil, in joy
 and sorrow, in love and hatred as well as devastating or upbuilding.
 
### #69 (Chapter 28)

 But consider, there is only this one Creation-energy and -power, which you can not only use and bring into
 activity, but also strengthen and widen through your consciousness as well as through your thoughts and feel-
 ings; apart from it there is nothing comparable, so therefore also no god-power which could cause any things
 in you, because each godhead is a fabulated imagination in insubstantiality and hence not capable of any energy
 or power.

### #70 (Chapter 28)

 And the Creation-energy with its power alone bears in itself the secret that sooner or later the precious and
 valueful always prevails, that the darkness must give way to the light, the evil to the good, the hatred to the
 love, the unknowledge to the knowledge, the unwisdom to the wisdom, and the disharmony, the unpeace
 and the unfreedom to the harmony, the peace and the freedom.

### #71 (Chapter 28)

 But to ensure that all the high values of the love, the freedom and harmony, of the peace, knowledge and wis-
 dom will not be long in coming, you human beings of Earth, you shall make a conscious effort and use the
 pure, neutral-positive-equalised Creation-energy and power in your consciousness to the noble, good and
 valueful, and build up the truth, its knowledge and its wisdom in yourselves.

### #72 (Chapter 28)

 Let the primal Creation-energy and its power be pure and unfold it in you, make it stronger and develop your
 consciousness-evolution out of it, as it is pregiven through the sense of the life.

### #73 (Chapter 28)

 And do not let your Creation-given consciousness-energy and its power fall into a weakening through wrong
 ideas, thoughts and feelings of a dullness and something impure, because you must use and direct the cre-
 ational energy and power in such a wise that it is always striking and decisive.

### #74 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, if you only have a little heedfulness and attentiveness for your thoughts and feelings, then you will recog-
 nise and perceive for yourselves what is the good and what is the evil, and indeed without having to speak it
 out or ruminate over it; recognising the good and the evil in yourselves in heedfulness and attentiveness is the
 right way of the cognition, not however a dull rumination, because this brings no cognitions but only confu-
 sion and waste of energy and power; rumination works like stringy morass, like a swamp which pulls every-
 thing into itself and paralyses and suffocates everything.

### #75 (Chapter 28)

 Be vigilant in your endeavours and connected to the gladness so that you gain real cognitions; if, however, you
 give yourselves over to the rumination, then you will get confused in all sorts of things which you will never
 be able to fathom, and this will make you depressed and sad.

### #76 (Chapter 28)

 You cannot change things that happened in the past nor can you make them good again, you can at the most
 give satisfaction for them such as by offering apologies or by making amends in whatever form, because once
 something has happened, it is no longer subject to any change.

### #77 (Chapter 28)

 You can leave all things of the past behind you and take the way to the height of the truth and the reality and
 to the bearing of the responsibility at every moment, if you do not shrink back in cowardice from the truth and
 reality.

### #78 (Chapter 28)

 Begin to think of the pure truth and to bear your responsibility for your existence and for everything that you
 nourish and cherish in terms of ideas, thoughts and feelings, that you act and do and handle; when you have
 dirty and terrible ideas, thoughts and feelings, clean them and build thereout good things and the best, because
 you are enabled to do this through the creational energy and power that is acting in you, so you can give every-
 thing a distinct direction through the kind of your will and your decisions through which you can reach the
 noblest and highest, if you make an honest effort.

### #79 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth in general, through your own ideas, thoughts and feelings as well as through your
 decisions and the free will you determine the love and hatred, the harmony and disharmony, the fairness and
 unfairness, the peace and war, the freedom and unfreedom as well as the fortune and unfortune; therefore
 raise your head and your forehead to the truthly truth and to the creational laws and recommendations so that
 you become knowing and wise therein, so you no longer call for a self-created terrible thing and none can
 befall you anymore as a result of your own doing.

### #80 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, through your free decision and your free will you can achieve anything you want, both in the good
 and in the evil, therefore always act in fairness according to the sense of the truth, because everything will
 always happen to you in a wise that corresponds to your own will, your thoughts and feelings and your respon-
 sibility-form, which you then call destiny.

### #81 (Chapter 28)

 And if you talk about what happens to you, then you presume to claim that what happens to you is rightful
 or unrightful, even though you yourselves determine what befalls you and what does not and thus you speak
 of a deserved or undeserved destiny, of reward and punishment, as you learn through your wrong human laws
 and through your religions and ideologies.

### #82 (Chapter 28)

 And when you speak of the destiny, then you mean that which befalls you through your own efforts, both in
 the fortune and unfortune, in the good and evil, although you presume to push off everything onto a god, tin
 god, human being or a karma, and you do this only so that you yourselves do not have to bear the responsi-
 bility.

### #83 (Chapter 28)

 You also do not make thoughts about what the destiny actually means so that you could understand that the destiny is the outcoming effects of your own energies and powers of your thoughts and feelings or the effects
which proceed onto you through distinct causes of other human beings, through nature or through happen-
ings and situations as well as through the universal connections, so therefore the law of cause and effect has its outcoming effect, in which the law of the interaction also takes effect.

### #84 (Chapter 28)

 The two laws of cause and effect and interaction have been given in the Creation since the primal beginning,
 therefore the big and enduring and indissoluble becoming and passing is connected therewith through the
 principles of the Creation.

### #85 (Chapter 28)

 What becomes will also pass again, and in this process the becoming is the cause and the passing the effect,
 whilst on the one hand with regard to the interaction a changeability, i.e. a change between this world and
 the other world comes about; on the other hand, the interaction is given in your current material life in such
 a wise that through your thoughts, feelings, actions, deeds and through all of your activity, corresponding reac-
 tions, consequences and effects arise.

### #86 (Chapter 28)

 The law of the interaction as well as the law of cause and effect and the law of becoming and passing ani-
 mate the immense creational system of the universe, hold it together in constant motion in the process of the
 311,040,000,000,000 (311 million million, 040 thousand million) years of the enduring existence of the
 Creation during which there is a constant becoming and passing and again a new becoming.

### #87 (Chapter 28)

 And just as the law of the interaction functions in the large, so it is also efficacious in you human beings of
 Earth, namely according to the principle: What you sow through your thoughts, feelings, actions and deeds as
 well as through all your activity, you will also reap; this is truly the activity and life in the entire Creation as it
 is untouchably and unmovably woven into the creational laws and recommendations in an ongoing outcoming
 effect, and these laws and recommendations in their all-embracing immenseness include everything conceiv-
 able and unconceivable for you and regulate even the tiniest speck of dust of a weight.

### #88 (Chapter 28)

 If you are heedful, vigilant and attentive, then you can experience everything in yourselves, if you only want
 to; therefore begin by the observing and perceiving of yourselves, but also by the environment that is visible
 for you.

### #89 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, what you call laws of the nature are the laws of the Creation as they are given through its laws in
 which are also included the recommendations and which are given to you as counsels for the fulfilment of the
 laws, because just as the laws include uncontrovertible distinctnesses with regard to their effects, so the recom-
 mendations are based on counsels which are to be used to follow the laws and to fulfil them in their evoluti-
 ve and life-affirming effects.

### #90 (Chapter 28)

 And the creational laws are not laid out for punishment but rather in such a wise that the following or not-
 following of them brings distinct positive or negative, i.e. good or bad effects which you determine yourselves
 willingly in logic through your thoughts and feelings, all your activity and your deeds and through your actions;
 therefore you yourselves bring about what is rightful and what is unrightful and what you consciously create
 therewith that is good or suggestively and forcefully bring about that is evil.

### #91 (Chapter 28)

 The creational laws and recommendations are constantly in permanent action, and consequently they act time-
 lessly and bring whatever you voluntarily, self-willedly and willingly create in the evil or good; and consider, the
 only effects resulting from these laws are that which you create yourselves, because it goes according to the
 principle that if good is sown, good can be reaped again, but if a weed is sown, only a weed can arise out of
 it.

### #92 (Chapter 28)

 Fundamentally, it is such with you human beings of Earth that you neither think about these things of the truth
 nor about yourselves, and as you do not think about the law-based happenings of the nature, nor about the
 laws and recommendations of the Creation, you never waste a thought on what, who and how you are; in
 consequence, these three questions also remain strange to you: „What is the human being“; „Who is the
 human being?“; „How is the human being?“

### #93 (Chapter 28)

 What is the human being? Fundamentally, the human being is individually a Wesen which has come out of an
 idea of the Creation and through its laws, as a consciously self-thinking Wesen with an evolution-capable con -
 sciousness as well as with an own free will and own free decision-making power for the purpose of the con -
 sciousness-evolution, which is the sense of the life; in this regard, it is also important as a human Wesen to create
 in oneself the true being human and the real humaneness in order to be human in the real and true sense
 which is expressed through fundamentally learning and following the creational laws and recommendations,
 wherethrough the fulfilment of the being human and the humaneness occurs; in this sense, the whole thing
 means that the Creation-given duties of the laws and recommendations are followed and fulfilled in the best
 possible framework, that also true love as well as inner harmony, freedom and peace are created in an equal -
 ised wise and are also carried to the outside and that all factors of what is evil, unfair, irresponsible and
 unrighteous are fundamentally avoided.

### #94 (Chapter 28)

 Who is the human being? Fundamentally, the human being is primarily an individuum, a single individual nature with a consciousness-block which forms the individuum and in which also the mental-block is integrated, that
is the consciousness, the thoughts, feelings and the psyche; what else is given in the consciousness-block is
the character, the personality, the subconsciousness, the ego, and the memory out of which altogether the
Who of the human being results, thus who he or she is through all the capabilities and factors of his or her
consciousness-block; the human being is in itself, through the consciousness-block and as a material individuum, an undivisible, a whole, just as he or she is an undivisible, a whole, together with the spirit, i.e. spirit-form that animates him or her, and that says, as soon as the life extinguishes and thus the spirit-form escapes out of the body and into its realm of the other world, the consciousness-block also escapes from the body and goes into the realm of the other world that is belonging to it; thus, the primary individuum, i.e. the consciousness-block dissolves, because as such it can only exist as long as the body actually lives and is inhabited by the spirit-form; so, when the life extinguishes, then only the lifeless, empty material shell without consciousness-block, i.e. indi- viduum remains; although the human being as a material Wesen with a consciousness-block is in himself or herself an undivisible whole, the human being is however not like that towards the outside, because he or she jointly lives and coexists secondarily through partaking of and participation in other things, so for example as a human being of his or her times, as a carrier of world historical ideas, as a child of the parents, as a husband and father, as a friend, employer or employee etc; through this he or she proves to himself or herself and to the outside world who he or she is by showing the factors and capabilities of his or her consciousness-block, i.e. his or her individuum in the outer world.

### #95 (Chapter 28)

 How is the human being? Fundamentally the human being is what he or she is in the core of his or her inner
 nature, i.e. what corresponds to his or her individuality that is based on the core of his or her inner nature
 which, however, as a rule strongly deviates from the individuality which he or she shows to the outside world;
 the core of the human individuality, i.e. the core of the human inner nature is of creational nature which striv-
 ingly pushes towards an evolution of the inner nature occurring through a consciousness-evolution, but as a
 rule the Creation-given striving and natural instinct is ignored, and consequently the human being creates in
 himself or herself an own and outer kind of the inner nature, i.e. individuality which, so to say as the chaff of
 the inner nature, surrounds its core; for this reason, he or she cannot really be how he or she is at the bottom
 of his or her inner nature, i.e. his or her creational individuality, because he or she decides himself or herself,
 at his or her own free choosing and will, how he or she wants to be, in which case he or she expresses this
 how-to-be through his or her self-created outer individuality.

### #96 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you human beings of Earth, you do not think about these things at all or not in great detail, but instead
 you let your immensely erring philosophers think for you who do not recognise the truth of the things but
 make themselves mere imaginations without comprehending the reality; and because you, like them, do not
 attempt to fathom the real truth of the things, you will thus also not become conscious of the great laws of
 the creational might which pulsate therein.

### #97 (Chapter 28)

 It is an implicitness for you not to think about the actual things of the truth and hence also not about the cre -
 ational laws and recommendations and their effects, and as a result you are faced with mysteries which need
 not be mysteries for you.

### #98 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, all laws and recommendations of the Creation have an effect on all things with absolute certainty
 and strength, not only on everything down to the coarsest and greatest and up to the finest and most tender,
 but also in all realms of the fine-fluidalness and high-fine-fluidalness.

### #99 (Chapter 28)

 Even in each single happening and in all motions in all expanses of the universe as well as in all levels of the
 substantial, semi-substantial, the fine-fluidal and high-fine-fluidal and the pure spiritual, the creational laws
 and recommendations act in an absolutely unchangeable wise, so therefore also in the most tender develop-
 ments of your thoughts and feelings which must be assigned to the semi-substantialness.

### #100 (Chapter 28)

 Do not assume, then, that elsewhere in the uncomprehensible expanses of the universe it would be different
 than on your Earth or amongst and in yourselves, because in the whole being that is both visible and invisible
 for you everything is given equally; thus every species brings forth its species and every kind its kind, irrespec-
 tive of what the form is made out of, be it material life forms or thoughts and feelings.

### #101 (Chapter 28)

 The process of fertilisation, germination, growing and becoming is continuous and it goes through everything
 equally and doesn't differentiate, so also no gap comes up, and the process doesn't stop in front of any part
 of the Creation, because the effects of the timeless process carry themselves through everything like an untear -
 able band which cannot be broken off nor taken off.

### #102 (Chapter 28)

 Even if you human beings of Earth for the most part isolate yourselves from the recognising and understanding of the universal processes through your intellect- and rationality-based restriction and through your deceptive
imagination and imperiousness, the laws of the nature and hence also the entire creational laws and recom-
mendations do not cease to exist, because despite your negation they continue to act in an unchangeable,
calm and constant kind and wise and determine through their interaction the destiny of the universe and of
all that which is included therein, so therefore also your outer destiny, upon which you have no influence.

### #103 (Chapter 28)

 The destiny which arises through the interaction also requires that everything that you sow must be reaped
 again by you there, where you bring the cause to an outcoming effect or effect.

### #104 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you always have the free decision and the free determination at the beginning of each matter, as well as the free will to decide whereto and in which direction you want to direct everything through your thoughts,
feelings, actions and deeds and through your activity; but you do not think at all or only vaguely about this,
which is why you cannot realise and understand the effects, i.e. the destiny out of the causes which you crea-
te yourselves; and out of your ununderstanding regarding this you assume then that the destiny that strikes you is either earned or unearned and furthermore brought onto you through your fellow human beings or through a higher might, because you refuse to understand that you yourselves are the former of your own destiny which you bring about yourselves and which has nothing to do with the destiny that acts from the out- side and which is the result out of foreordinations over which you have no might.

### #105 (Chapter 28)

 The destiny which you determine yourselves through your thoughts and feelings, through your activity and your
 actions and deeds is based on consequences, i.e. effects which you yourselves create through distinct causes
 and which you then have to bear as your destiny, both in the good as in the evil.

### #106 (Chapter 28)

 Nevertheless, there are however a large number amongst you human beings of Earth who claim in your dumb
 unintellect and in your irrationality that the human being has no free will, if he or she is after all subject to his
 or her destiny; thereby it is not considered in any wise that it is precisely the free will of the human being
 through which each one determines his or her destiny himself or herself, namely through the law of the inter-
 action.

### #107 (Chapter 28)

 Each outcoming effect which falls back upon you human beings of Earth as destiny is based at the beginning
 in the cause of your thoughts and feelings as well as in your activity and in your actions and deeds which you
 conceive in advance in free decision and realise in free will; however, the foolishness of the claim that you do
 not have a free will is based in the purpose of the self-stupefaction and self-excuse as well as in the fact of the
 resentment and grumbling thereover, that you have to integrate yourselves into the law of the interaction and
 therefore also have to bear the responsibility for your destiny yourselves, whether you want to or not; never-
 theless, though, you have your own free will in this regard too, and as a consequence you yourselves can deter-
 mine your thoughts and feelings, your activity and your actions and deeds in their kind, so therefore also the
 outcoming effects and effects arising out of them, and indeed both in the good as in the evil.

### #108 (Chapter 28)

 Each destiny and each interaction is thus preceded by your own free and willing decision, and this means that
 with each first decision and volition you create something each time which manifests itself to you as interaction
 and destiny; therefore, you will, sooner or later, have to live in what you today determinatively create through
 your thoughts and feelings, through your activity and through your deeds and actions and out of which you
 will inevitably have to bear the consequences when you are struck by it, that is by the destiny.

### #109 (Chapter 28)

 However, when the consequences, i.e. the destiny resulting out of your thoughts, feelings, decisions, deeds,
 actions and your activity, will strike you is fundamentally different for each consequence, so it can be imme-
 diately or only in a few hours, days, weeks or months or perhaps even in years or decades, but it will certainly
 be in your present actual life, because nothing can be carried into the fine-fluidal world of the other world nor
 into a new life on Earth, as is erroneously mistaught through various of your religious, ideological and philo-
 sophical irrational teachings, as for example through the far-from-the-truth irrational Karma-teaching.

### #110 (Chapter 28)

 If the thoughts, feelings, deeds, actions and the activity are subject to changes, this can, of course, lead to
 changes in the effects, i.e. in the destiny and in the interactions; thus when evil and negative things and factors
 of the thoughts and feelings as well as of the activity, actions and deeds are changed to the good and positive
 and henceforth led and lived in this wise, then also new effects, i.e. a new destiny and new interactions form
 themselves out of these new causes, as is given through the creational laws and recommendations in fairness;
 through a change to the good, better, best and positive, the interaction changes developmentally in the same
 wise, through which the old is replaced and extinguished through the new, as the creational law of the fair-
 ness determines it, that only that happens which corresponds to the present reality.

### #111 (Chapter 28)

 The laws and recommendations of the Creation are, in their mode of functioning, bound to cause and effect,
 and consequently the effect changes according to a new cause, which means that an effect resulting from an
 old cause can change to the good or bad, if a new and corresponding cause is created; but this says that, for
 example, out of an evil and negative cause, logically a correspondingly evil and negative effect can be stopped
 and changed to a good and positive effect, if the corresponding cause is changed to the good or positive as
 this comes about with the destiny and the interactions and which has both a direct and indirect effect on you
 human beings of Earth; so however also on prophecies which serve as warnings for effects proceeding out of
 distinct bad, evil and negative causes, which however can be changed to the better and best through the crea-
 ting of new, good and positive causes.

### #112 (Chapter 28)

 Fundamentally, you human beings of Earth are bound to your own works, to your thoughts and feelings, to
 your activity, your deeds and actions, and indeed both with regard to yourselves and concerning your next ones
 and fellow human beings, for or against whom you direct everything.

### #113 (Chapter 28)

 If you take a decision to do evil or terrible things to yourselves, your next ones or your fellow human beings,
 be it in thoughts, feelings, works or words, you therewith set something into the world which develops itself
 further in the same and wanted wise, is active and has an effect, and indeed irrespective of whether the whole
 is visible or invisible and hence fine-fluidal or coarse-substantial.
 
### #114 (Chapter 28)

 How the effect of your evil and terrible thoughts and feelings forms itself on yourselves, your next ones or the
 fellow human beings, lies entirely in the psychical and consciousness-based condition of yourselves, your next
 ones or the fellow human beings which determines whether the attack can bring harm or not.

### #115 (Chapter 28)

 The psychical and consciousness-based condition of yourselves, your next ones and the fellow human beings
 is always decisive, so therefore nobody is defencelessly exposed to any attacks, and you can defend yourselves,
 both against yourselves and against external attacks, just as your next ones and fellow human beings can
 defend themselves against attacks from you and others.

### #116 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, as creator of your decisions and your volition and hence of the cause set in motion therethrough,
 you remain under all circumstances connected with it, so everything again and again comes back to you as
 destiny and as interaction and strikes you, and indeed irrespective of whether this happens after a short or first
 after a long time and whether the cause is good or evil.

### #117 (Chapter 28)

 The law of the interaction and hence also your destiny, you human beings of Earth, is triggered by attracting
 again various same-kinds through the motion of a creation, such as thoughts, feelings, deeds and actions as
 well as an activity of any kind, just as these same-kinds are themselves also attracted by such, and this results
 in a symbiotic connection out of which an immense power-source comes about; the whole accumulates to a
 great energy with great power which acts as a sender and sends back everything to the former.

### #118 (Chapter 28)

 Through the accumulation of the energy and power which leads back to the thought-feeling-based cause, an
 ever greater compaction forms, and it is through this that a coarse-substantial factor, i.e. the destiny ultimately
 results which the creator of the corresponding thoughts and feelings must experience, live and work out him-
 self or herself; that is the actual developmental process of your so feared and misunderstood destiny which
 arises as an effect out of a self-created cause.

### #119 (Chapter 28)

 Recognise therefore, that your self-created destiny is always and down to the finest and smallest nuance fair
 and corresponds to the effects of the creational laws, because through the attraction and accumulation of your
 own thoughts and feelings, your deeds, actions and your activity you attract the same kind again, and it falls
 back onto you, and indeed exactly as you have created and wanted it as cause, only strengthened; it does not
 matter whether the whole thing is directed at yourselves, your next ones or the fellow human beings in general,
 because the process is always the same.

### #120 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, only the kind of your conscious or unconscious volition, for which you yourselves decide, is determinative
 for the interaction and hence also for your destiny, because all the innumerable fine-fluidal and semi-material
 swinging waves with which you are connected let everything that you send out through your thoughts and
 feelings stream back onto you, irrespective of whatever you want and what you create with your volition as
 causes.

### #121 (Chapter 28)

 The interactions which you create through your wanted causes also have an effect on your outer nature, i.e.
 on your outer individuality, which you equally primarily create yourselves and which is far from the creational
 individuality, which is located in the core of your inner nature; and just as you form your individuality and out
 of this also your character through your thoughts and feelings and your attitude etc., so the interactions of
 your thoughts and feelings also have an effect on it, and consequently also your character is influenced and
 continually formed therethrough.

### #122 (Chapter 28)

 Apart from all the many factors which carry out everything necessary out of and in you, many things of the
 gigantic power-source of the universe are also acting in you, but actually there is nothing amongst you human
 beings of Earth with regards to your self-created destiny for which you do not first give the cause thereto your-
 selves.

### #123 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, it is you yourselves who through your thoughts and feelings as well as through your general and specific
 activity, deeds and doing bring about everything which you have to bear.

### #124 (Chapter 28)

 What you sow, that you will reap, and indeed in every respect, be it in the good or in the evil; therefore you
 cannot refer to your invented godheads and tin gods or to your next ones, fellow human beings or to your
 imaginary angels, saints and idolised human beings with regard to the responsibility, because this lies by you
 alone for all things, for everything that your destiny brings you, as also for everything whatsoever that happens
 in the world in terms of war and peace, love and hatred, fairness and unfairness, freedom and unfreedom,
 harmony and disharmony as well as in terms of good and everything evil.

### #125 (Chapter 28)

 It is completely irresponsible, reckless, conscienceless and duty-neglecting of you human beings of Earth to
 push the responsibility for your doing, deeds and activity and for everything that you create in you as ideas,
 thoughts, feelings and decisions through your own will as destiny onto an angel, saint, idolised human being,
 your next ones or any fellow human being or to shove it off onto a fabulated god or tin god and then to
 wonder in uncomprehensibility why he or she allows the fate to befall you.

### #126 (Chapter 28)

 It is irresponsible to think in this wise and to assume that it is right, and if you do such things nevertheless,
 then you prove to yourselves that you are not willing to give enough consideration to the truth, nor to recog-
 nise it in all its entire range, because in imperiousness you want to bathe yourselves in innocence and bear no
 responsibility in any wise for your incorrect and haphazard deeds.
 
### #127 (Chapter 28)

 And since you are not willing to bear the responsibility for your doing, activity and deeds nor for your ideas,
 thoughts and feelings, you reach out for all little and big things to put them into action directly according to
 your irresponsible reflecting and striving, through which you wreak terribleness through all disastrous things of
 the world by indulging in hatred and jealousy, strife and murder and manslaughter, creating unpeace, unfree-
 dom, disharmony and wars all over the world, and bringing therewith depravity and destruction over the whole
 humankind and your planet; and through all this you not only determine your own destiny but also that of
 your next ones, your fellow human beings, the whole humankind and Earth.

### #128 (Chapter 28)

 Already as individuals you create heavy destinies and great sorrows and problems which you carry into the
 world, and creating therewith hardship, misery and war as well as other terrible things, and indeed in complete
 forgottenness of your ample responsibility which you have to bear yourselves for all and everything and which
 also determines your destiny and that of the humankind in the good or evil, depending on whether you fulfil
 it or not; consider that you are your own destiny, because depending on whether you create good or evil in
 your thoughts and feelings, you will also be such in your self-created part of your inner nature.

### #129 (Chapter 28)

 From the beginning, the Creation created its all-embracing laws and recommendations through which you
 human beings of Earth automatically make use of their unbribable effects, so everything fulfils itself without
 any doubt down to the last fibre of the laws and recommendations when you trigger them, in which case a
 preferential treatment is as impossible as is a disadvantageous one and consequently only fairness, but never
 an unfairness is possible.

### #130 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, the creational laws and recommendations and their effects do not have to care about you human beings
 of Earth, rather, you must care about them, because the all-embracing work of the Creation with regard to its
 laws and recommendations is in its kind not dependent on you, but you are dependent on it.

### #131 (Chapter 28)

 The main error you human beings of Earth make is that you see only your material existence and that you
 assess everything only according to this; and included in this error is also your conceit of seeing yourselves as
 a uniqueness and centre of all life forms, even though you are not; in addition to you, there exists in the ex-
 panses of the universe many other civilisations of various kinds who are of equally great importance in the
 machinery of all created creations who found their existence through the creational laws and recommenda-
 tions, so you cannot megalomaniacally assume to be the centre of all life forms.

### #132 (Chapter 28)

 And a further error you many amongst you make is that you assume that as a personality you would only have
 a unique life, because truthly after the dying, the life continues in a new existence on Earth but contrary to the
 irrational teaching of the person-bound reincarnation; truthly the personality extinguishes after the dying and
 developmentally changes itself in the fine-fluidal realm of the other world of the overall consciousness-block
 into a neutral energy out of which a new and unburdened consciousness with an equally new personality is
 created which is then born anew, together with the spirit-form of the human being which, after the dying of
 the material body, also goes into its fine-fluidal realm of the other world and from out of there reincarnates
 again and, contrary to the personality, is alone capable of being reborn; so you shall be conscious that you
 have already often lived a material-current life as always new personalities, just as you will continue again and
 again, as always new personalities, to pass through new lives; and that will happen so often and for such a
 long time until your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form has developed so highly through your evolution of your con-
 sciousness that it no longer needs a material body and consciousness anymore and thus goes as a higher form
 into a higher level.

### #133 (Chapter 28)

 It follows that with the new birth of the new personality a completely new life begins, and consequently the
 new human being at his or her actual becoming, i.e. the actual birth on the 21st day of the pregnancy, i.e.
 after the conception, is completely unburdened and hence innocent; the reason for this is because out of the
 earlier life of the preceding personality – as well as of all other preceding personalities before that – nothing
 disadvantageous is put into the new personality, and it is therefore completely unburdened at its becoming;
 the fact that the real birth of the human being occurs on the 21st day after the conception is because the spirit-
 form is, together with the new consciousness and the new personality, born into the embryo and gives life to
 it; as is well known, the actual worldly, i.e. material birth into the existence of the world normally occurs only
 after completion of the pregnancy.

### #134 (Chapter 28)

 Through this process alone it is guaranteed that every newborn human being is unburdened by his or her
 thoughts, feelings, actions, deeds, and his or her activities out of his or her previous life and those before that,
 just as the creational laws determine that every new life form to be born, and thus also the human being, shall
 be of pure and unburdened consciousness; therefore it is given – contrary to many irrational teachings of false
 prophets, religions, sects, ideologies and philosophies – that all happenings may only be related to the earthly
 existence, therefore the fairness of the creational laws determines that all returning effects, i.e. interactions as
 well as other causes and effects and hence also the destiny falls completely onto the time span of the life on
 Earth; and accordingly, both atonement processes in the fine-fluidal realm of the other world and in a religiously
 explained heaven or in a hell are as senseless as the wrong karma-teaching which states that the consequences
 of the preceding life would have to be borne in the coming life.
 
### #135 (Chapter 28)

 So turn away from the irrational teachings and erroneous assumptions of your religions, ideologies and philo-
 sophies and try to find the true logic in the truth which you can experience and fathom through the teaching
 of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life to which you shall turn in free will and without
 coercion, so that you may find your true life.

### #136 (Chapter 28)

 If you follow the effective truth, then you follow therewith also the creational laws and recommendations, so
 you do not have to worry unnecessarily about your volition, because alone through you turning to the truth
 and recognising it, does the will rise high in you, in accordance with the laws of the Creation, to the connection
 with the truth.

### #137 (Chapter 28)

 And with the will rising in you to the connection with the truth, you set a boundary for uncontrolled interac-
 tions which strike you as hard destiny, because through your volition of the turning to the truth you destroy
 all the terrible returning effects and create new ones which are good and positive and which bring you joy and
 gladness, through which you create true love and harmony in yourselves and find inner peace and inner free-
 dom.

### #138 (Chapter 28)

 And if you understand how to willingly form your destiny through good interactions, then you will therewith
 create an immensely strong power-source in you, out of which will proceed a constant accumulation, i.e.
 strengthening of your good energies and powers, wherethrough the good and best will become more and
 more firm in you; this will then also lead to everything emanating out of you into the environment as fine-fluidal
 swinging waves where it will be taken in by your fellow human beings who then sooner or later slowly but
 surely form themselves according to them, thereby creating, just like you, a protective shield of the good
 around them which gives protection against the truth-unknowledgeness; if then old returning effects through
 fellow human beings still occur, then these can easily be mastered and cleared up through intellect and ratio-
 nality and a corresponding logic, through which even enmities come to an end and you go forth as a truth-
 human being who lives in love, peace, freedom and harmony both with himself or herself and equally with all
 his or her fellow human beings.

### #139 (Chapter 28)

 You shall not simply live according to your present terms of a religious, ideological or philosophical fashion and
 direct your thoughts and feelings as well as your reflecting and striving according to them, but instead you
 shall in reality be a truth-human being, because only then will you form a valueful connecting link with regard
 to the entire consciousness-evolution of your whole humankind.

### #140 (Chapter 28)

 Your own consciousness is, through your subconsciousness, collectively connected with your fellow human
 beings of your whole humankind and unites you, so it is possible for you to experience and to overlook many
 things or to simultaneously live the same in a certain small number, to have the same thoughts, to do the same
 or to invent the same.

### #141 (Chapter 28)

 Thereto, you not only have the subconsciousness for your utilisation, but as a truth-human being also your
 intellect and your rationality, through which you are able to guide and hence direct everything.

### #142 (Chapter 28)

 Rationality and intellect are high semi-material values through which you direct your earthly existence, and through which you recognise the truth and reality and thus can become a truth-human being, if you strive for this.

### #143 (Chapter 28)

 Intellect and rationality are therefore, for the truth-human being, the driving power out of his or her conscious-
 ness which in turn receives its life-energy out of the spirit-form through which the material body primarily
 awakens to the life.

### #144 (Chapter 28)

 Your intellect and your rationality are first and foremost bound to the material space-time-definition, however
 they are also able to comprehend things of the fine-fluidalness and hence rise themselves above earthly space-
 and time-definitions into the high-fine-fluidal spacelessness and timelessness, and indeed through the energies
 and powers of the consciousness which are able to move outward via the pineal gland and manifest themselves;
 it is therefore an irrational teaching to claim that intellect and rationality could never move timelessly outside
 of the material space and the time.

### #145 (Chapter 28)

 And just as intellect and rationality can stir fine-fluidally in the realm outside of the material space-time-config- uration through the energy and power of the consciousness via the pineal gland, so also stir the fine-spiritual
perceptions – which are not identical with the feelings – in the fine-fluid-realm outside of the material space-
time-definition, because they are, as explained, of a fine-fluidal kind and arise out of the Gemüt of the fine-
fluidal spirit-form-realm which is steplessly bordered off from the high-fine-fluid-realm of the spirit-form itself.

### #146 (Chapter 28)

 Equipped in this form in an energetical and powerful intellect-, rationality- and consciousness-based wise, you human beings of Earth are deeply connected with the fine-fluidal and the high-fine-fluidal, and the fine-fluidal
lies in that realm which is still connected with the semi-fine-fluidal, i.e. the semi-material such as the thoughts
and feelings, whereas the pure fine-fluidal already belongs to the outer realm of the spirit-energy-conditioned,
and the high-fine-fluidal belongs to the direct realm of the pure creational energy which, as spirit, i.e. spirit-form
in you, animates your consciousness, i.e. the entire consciousness-block and the therein included mental-block.

### #147 (Chapter 28)

 Through the energy and power of the consciousness and the connection with the pineal gland you are, in the midst of your earthly-material existence, consciously or unconsciously as the case may be, in sensibility with the
energy and power of your spirit-form which, however, is only possible for you human beings, whereas the
worlds of the animals and other creatures and everything that crawls and flies is excluded therefrom; to enable you to consciously perceive the connection with the creational energy of your spirit-form it requires that you, as truth-human beings, follow the creational laws and recommendations and in the knowledge of the truth use all your attentiveness and heedfulness on this; and truly only you Wesen of the human kind are capable thereto.

### #148 (Chapter 28)

 You alone as Wesen of the human kind are able to make a connection in a conscious wise between the fine-
 fluidal, the high-fine-fluidal and the material-coarse-substantial, wherethrough you are able to realise the pure
 life of the fine-fluidal and spiritual and make a harmonious interaction between this and your deep coarse-sub-
 stantial-material.

### #149 (Chapter 28)

 Human beings of Earth, your majority however does not fulfil the creational task of the consciousness-evolu-
 tion, because you separate the two worlds of the fine-fluidal and the coarse-substantial, instead of firmly unit-
 ing them and consciously stirring in both of them.

### #150 (Chapter 28)

 Through your self-acquired characteristic of concentrating solely on the material you human beings of Earth
 have effectively made yourselves to masters of your coarse-substantial world, and as a result of your doing,
 handling and acting, the material world has also become dependent on you; but you use this dependence of
 your world to torment it in every imaginable wise, for example through chemistry, irresponsible exploitation of
 the resources, through overpopulation and the immense resultant problems which can no longer be solved,
 such as the destruction of the climate, mass migrations, water and food scarcity, hatred, war, torture and the
 destruction of the environment and nature, the eradication of many animal, bird and fish species etc.; for bet-
 ter or for worse, your world has become dependent on you and perforce suffers in its own kind and wise under
 your terror and through the destructions which you cause upon it and to it.

### #151 (Chapter 28)

 It is you alone who can raise your Earth again, if you stop with all your terror and with your destructions, and if you get your overpopulation under control, out of which all evil terrible things and problems proceed; but
consider that your way will be very long to restoring on your planet the state which for you is a true life-source.

### #152 (Chapter 28)

 Instead of honouring and taking care of your earthly home, you have brought terribleness over it, and you have
 done that not least because you have suppressed in yourselves everything that is necessary for your coarse-
 substantial and your fine-fluidal world so that interactions can flow; equally, just as the oxygen-enriched blood
 is incessantly pumped through the heart and your arteries to ensure that the body remains fresh and healthy,
 so it is with the interaction between your coarse-substantial and fine-fluidal world; if the flow is cut, however,
 then illness and confusion will ensue which will ultimately end in a catastrophe.

### #153 (Chapter 28)

 And you human beings of Earth, you have indeed failed badly in this respect, because you have not only used
 your intellect and your rationality as necessary tools, but you have submitted yourselves only in material sense
 to your intellect and rationality and set both as ruler over yourselves; but in doing so you have left out of your
 attention and forgotten everything that is connected with the world of the fine-fluidal which has the conse-
 quence that you can only comprehend the coarse-substantial, not however the fine-fluidal, and therefore you
 are completely dependent on the coarse-substantial and material; so you have made yourselves the slaves of
 your own tool, the slaves of your intellect and your rationality, and as a result you have become human beings
 of pure intellect and rationality and proudly call yourselves materialists, but only with the disadvantage that
 your intellect and rationality show immense deficiency symptoms with regard to the logic and hence do not
 show any great value; there are very many amongst you who, even if you carry high titles, in your intellect and
 in your rationality you are still in the beginnings of your development and are currently climbing the first step
 of the real life-schooling.

### #154 (Chapter 28)

 Those amongst you who have entirely submitted to the intellect and the rationality, which in your case, however,
 severely lack in logic, you have so bitten into the material, i.e. chained yourselves to everything coarse-substanti-
 al, that you can no longer perceive, understand and comprehend anything beyond the earthly space- and time-
 definition, because you have entirely submitted yourselves to your illogical pure coarse-substantial-material
 reflecting and striving; but in doing so you have put yourselves in your own chains and curtail and encapsulate
 the horizon of your comprehension-capability to such a degree with your restricted and narrowed as well as
 illogical intellect and your rationality of the same kind that true intellect, true rationality and true logic have
 become as strange and unknown to you as the alphabet is to a cow.

### #155 (Chapter 28)

 You have separated the connection between the fine-fluidal and coarse-substantial so strongly that a dense
 wall has built up between them, and as a result, you have also lost, with regard to the fine-spiritual-based per-
 ception, the life-source, the purely creational which is far raised above space and time and stands high above
 the fine-fluidal; for this reason, it is not possible for you all who are materialists amongst you human beings
 of Earth, to recognise the effective truth nor therefore the core of your inner nature which is formed through
 a creational fact.

### #156 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, if you want to turn to the real truth and win cognition with regard to the creational laws and recommen- dations, then you must let your intellect and your rationality grow up and learn to use them in logic; so you
must liberate yourselves from the pure intellect and the pure rationality of the nothing but coarse-substantial and voluntarily get rid of the self-forged chains of your coarse-substantial slavery.

### #157 (Chapter 28)

 You amongst you human beings of Earth who live apart from the effective truth and far from the following of
 the creational laws and recommendations, you live in purely materialistic, earth-bound, and low-standing
 thoughts and feelings, and you are very inadequate in your intellect and in your rationality; your thoughts, feel-
 ings and endeavours are only characterised by pathological craving for earnings and profit, by hatred, revenge,
 retaliation and war, by torture, lies, cheating, robbery and suppression as well as sensual lust, defamation,
 greed, pathological craving and vices etc. through which you inexorably bring about interactions of the same
 kind; through that you form everything worse and worse and drive yourselves to do more and more terrible
 things which will ultimately break in over you as gruesome destruction and elimination.

### #158 (Chapter 28)

 And in your delusion you even trade with the death through assisted suicide and in doing so you enrich your-
 selves on the riches of the self-murderer, and you make yourselves into murderers and are excited about and
 take delight in the dying of those who end their lives in sheer cowardice.

### #159 (Chapter 28)

 But your delusion also drives you to beget offspring in an uncontrolled wise and to increasingly push the world
 which is already overpopulated with human beings into an overpopulation disaster, out of which ever more
 immense problems emerge, and indeed besides the destruction of the nature and the climate also the there-
 out resulting natural catastrophes, pollution of air, water and soil, worldwide terrorism, wars, murder and other
 crimes, torture, epidemics, deficiency of water and famines, criminality, energy shortages, physical and psychical
 Gewalt, immorality, coldness and unconcernedness of you human beings towards one another, deterioration
 of the interhuman relationships, diseases, unweather of all kinds, earthquakes and volcano eruptions, weaken-
 ing and ever more drastic life-uncapability of you human beings, ever more lax and insufficient handling of the
 penal laws and the protection of the lives of human beings, animals and all other creatures of the air, the water
 and the earth.

### #160 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you have already created a world-judgement in the form of immense catastrophes which break in over
 you and which you already can no longer evade; you are in the midst of a self-created tremendous storm which
 is brewing over you and which now pours out terribleness and destruction over you, and if you continue to
 potter about as before, then the elimination is going to break in over you without hope of rescue; therefore
 you shall bethink yourselves and search for the way of the truth in order to walk upon it and to follow the
 creational laws and recommendations, because only by doing so can you still prevent the worst.

### #161 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth in general, you do not see yourselves as connecting link between the fine-fluidal
 and the coarse-substantial, therefore you do not know how to use the animating, refreshing and furthering
 energies and powers of both worlds; you separate yourselves into two worlds but you only pay attention to
 the coarse-substantial one and chain yourselves to it, whereas you withdraw yourselves from your connection
 to the fine-fluidal which you should necessarily use in order to find and lead, through the interaction between
 the fine-fluidal and the coarse-substantial, a valueful equalisation and a true life according to the creational
 laws and recommendations.

### #162 (Chapter 28)

 But you are weak and without energy and power in your volition for the true life, for the truth, fairness, the
 strength of the character and the righteousness, which is why you lazily wallow in the purely material and
 through your unintellect and through your habitual irrationality you do not realise that you are heading
 towards a tremendous crisis which will shake you with immense shivering fits and burn you.

### #163 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, everything that you do falls back onto you, because this lies in the natural happening itself, as it is
 given through the creational laws; thus all your thoughts and feelings take, through the energy and power that
 animates them, and as soon as they arise, a form that corresponds to their content and they swing out from
 you and attract again things of the same kind; you however remain connected with your thoughts and feel -
 ings in fine-fluidalness in a swinging-wave-based wise, thus everything sent out attracts, through the interac-
 tion, things of the same kind and comes back to you again; therefore your own thoughts and feelings pulsate
 through you fine-fuidally just as this happens to those who receive your corresponding mental and feeling-
 based impulsations and who respond to them in the fashion that they return back to you.

### #164 (Chapter 28)

 Your thoughts and feelings that awaken to the life and the reality in the fine-fluidal, attract, after going out
 from you as swinging waves, things of the same kind and swing back to the starting point, i.e. to the origin,
 because you are incessantly in connection with them; thus, you are struck again by your own thoughts and
 feelings as well as by those of your fellow human beings who are equally directed with regard to their thoughts
 and feelings; therefore, the returning thoughts and feelings discharge themselves in you, and indeed without
 you being able to consciously perceive it; through this, further thoughts and feelings of the same kind are trig-
 gered in you, out of which again the effect of the boomerang-like recoil-power results which leads to the fact
 that you chain yourselves more and more in the same thought- and feeling-world and remain its slave; there-
 fore it is of urgency that you bring your thoughts and feelings under control and onto the way of the truth by
 turning away from the evil, bad and the purely negative and instead turning to the good, best and the positive-
 equalised.
 
### #165 (Chapter 28)

 Consider you are always being struck by the outcoming effects of your own thoughts and feelings whose con-
 stant creator and nurturer you are, and indeed both in the form of the good, the best and positive and in the
 form of the evil, bad and negative.

### #166 (Chapter 28)

 And consider further, in order that the damaging back-falling Gewalt of the interaction through the thoughts
 and feelings does not reach out to more and more people and does not continue to grasp things of the same
 kind of the fellow human beings, and wreak more and more terribleness, you must therefore free yourselves
 from the purely material, i.e. coarse-substantial and come to a consensus with the fine-fluidal as well as with
 the truth and with the creational laws and recommendations.

### #167 (Chapter 28)

 All of you, you human beings of Earth, you must learn to fulfil all that which you shall do in the existence of
 your life and hence also in the realm of the Creation, so that you are a connecting link between the material,
 the fine-fluidal and the spiritual of the Creation-energy, so you can enjoy in fullness out of the material and
 out of the fine-fluidal as well as out of the spiritual energy and power of the Creation.

### #168 (Chapter 28)

 Clean yourselves in your thoughts and feelings so that you let yourselves be guided though the creational truth
 and through the Creation-given laws and recommendations which are well above all material things; to do that
 you only need to pull your intellect and your rationality out of the darkness of your unlogic and your
 unknowledge and build them up logically; and if you learn to do that, then you will be able to gather experi-
 ences, live them and use them as a tool in order to fulfil your life in the coarse-substantial existence in logic,
 intellect and rationality, and through this you will also constantly further, cleanse and raise the entire coarse-
 substantial Creation, and out of this, true love, harmony, freedom and peace will grow step by step, both in
 yourselves and in the whole humankind.

### #169 (Chapter 28)

 And if you do accordingly, then through every interaction something powerful, good and positive will also
 logically flow back again, especially true love and freedom, harmony and peace, by which ultimately your
 whole humankind will be befallen and live therein, through which a new, equal, peaceful and harmonious
 world will finally arise.

### #170 (Chapter 28)

 You shall become true human beings in correct fulfilment of all your actions, your entire activity and deeds as
 well as your thoughts, feelings, wishes, efforts and requirements, so that you are noble human beings and can
 honour yourselves as greatest work of the Creation.

### #171 (Chapter 28)

 As greatest work of the Creation you however eschew pronouncing the words Creation and truth, even
 though these two terms should be closer to you than anything else.

### #172 (Chapter 28)

 The fact that you do not dare to pronounce the words does not lie in the honour in dignity for them, but rather
 that you are stricken by confusion and angst, because on the one hand you are bound in a belief to a god, tin
 god or idolised human being and fear their punishment, and on the other hand, because already as children you
 were not taught the truth, neither through your parents nor through other educators, neither through teachers
 nor through others whose duty it would have been to teach you in the truth and in the creational laws and
 recommendations.

### #173 (Chapter 28)

 Nobody has given you clear information, if you have ever searched for the effective truth of all truth, and so
 your thirst for truth was not satisfied, and as a result it remained fundamentally and in all things a mystery to
 you, which you have in the end simply put up with without fathoming it any further; under these circumstances,
 your searching for the effective truth of all truth, the truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations,
 cannot happen intimately and as trustingly as you should be able to do.

### #174 (Chapter 28)

 But somehow or other you shall and must come closer to the truth of all truth, sooner or later, and so it is also foolish of you to assume that it could be unright to concern yourselves extensively with the truth, with the
Creation and with the creational laws and recommendations and in the process to free yourselves from the
belief in your god, tin god or idolised human being; so do not assume that it is not rightful to turn to the truth
and to cast off your belief in your god, tin god or idolised human being; and do not let yourselves be misled
in this respect through your convenience and your indolence, nor through those who claim that your freeing
yourselves from your belief in a godhead, an idolised human being or a tin god is evil outrage, because, on the
contrary, an outrage against the truth is given through a religious, sectarian, ideological or philosophical belief.

### #175 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, if you search for the truthly truth, then it requires that you search for an approach to the whole
 Creation, which means that you must turn to the creational laws and recommendations and that you must
 realise them and follow them.

### #176 (Chapter 28)

 When approaching the whole Creation, uprightness and modesty are asked for, not however doggish submis-
 siveness, because to show this to the truth and the Creation is a boundless overbearingness and an abasement
 beyond compare against them, because the truth and the Creation do not require your humble worship and
 submissiveness, slavish mentality, crawling servility and serving the will of others, but rather esteem and dignity,
 both for them and for yourselves.

### #177 (Chapter 28)

 Your esteem and dignity concerning the truth and the whole Creation as well as yourselves is not laid out so that truth and Creation must approach you, because it is you yourselves who, through your intellect and your
rationality in recognition of the reality, must approach them, recognise them and follow their laws and recom- mendations.

### #178 (Chapter 28)

 But truly, amongst the majority of you human beings of Earth there is only convenience and hypocritical reli-
 gious, ideological and philosophical belief, wrapped in the villainous cloak of the submissiveness and dignity-
 lessness towards yourselves and with regard to the truth, the laws and recommendations of the Creation, the
 entire creation all around and especially the Creation as Universal Consciousness.

### #179 (Chapter 28)

 But you amongst you, you who no longer want to sleep in truth-unknowledgeness and in non-following of
 the creational laws and recommendations, you who search, in honesty, esteem and dignity, for the truth of all
 truth and strive for fulfilment of the creational laws and recommendations, take in the tidings of the teaching
 of the prophets, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life as it is given to
 you in the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, so that you comprehend the right thing.

### #180 (Chapter 28)

 Be certain: There is only one Creation as all-embracing energy and power which gives life to everything in
 existence and to all created creations, namely the Universal Consciousness which as the whole Creation also
 includes itself and everything created through it; and there is no god, no tin god and no idolised human being
 who would, even in a speck of dust of a weight, be equal to the Creation, because all godheads and tin gods
 are only insubstantialities fabulated by you human beings and are without any energy and power, just like the
 human beings who you raise to idols of godly equivalence.

### #181 (Chapter 28)

 Through your wrong doing in your belief in godheads, tin gods and idolised human beings you close off the
 heaven and the paradise which strive in you, in form of your psyche and your consciousness-state, for revela-
 tion, which you, however, maliciously suppress in yourselves through your consciousness-based and psychical
 state of the hell; you no longer let yourselves be guided through the effective truth of all truth and hence not
 through the creational laws and recommendations and therefore not through the reality; you have, in a self-
 chosen wise, raised your earthly intellect and your rationality to the unlogic and have submitted yourselves to
 it and to the truth-unknowledgeness, and thus you have become the tool of your own inadequacy, irrational-
 ity and your unintellect and have moved further and further away from the truth and from the laws and recom-
 mendations of the Creation.

### #182 (Chapter 28)

 In doing so you have, as individuals and as whole humankind, carried out a separation between the truth, the
 creational and the material, through which you are mainly connected only to the earthly which is absolutely
 bound only to the material and its space and time; but that is something that the creational laws and recom-
 mendations do not include as such, but rather it is your own, purely human work, and this is why you are un-
 able to understand the truth and the laws and recommendations of the Creation.

### #183 (Chapter 28)

 The longer you wait to find and follow the effective truth of all truth, the greater the cleft will be between the
 reality and unreality as well as between the truth about the knowledge and the untruth about the knowledge,
 as a result of which you increasingly chain yourselves to the material.

### #184 (Chapter 28)

 You are nothing more than earthbound intellectual and rational human beings who call yourselves materialists with pride because you do not see the chains with which you have shackled yourselves to the purely earthly
and its space and time, through which you have narrowed the horizon of your own intellect and rationality to
such an extent that you no longer recognise the logic and truth of the reality and also cannot understand them.

### #185 (Chapter 28)

 And if you ask how you can find the truth and reality out of this, then the answer is that this is impossible for
 you, if you do not bestir yourselves and if the help does not come from yourselves, because it is you yourselves
 who must take pity on you and enable you to reveal the truth of all truth and the reality to your low intellect
 and your equally low rationality, so that you can also comprehend and follow the Creation and its laws and
 recommendations.

### #186 (Chapter 28)

 And you shall not ridicule those amongst you who strive for the truth and reality, because you yourselves are
 narrow in your intellect and in your rationality and are unable to extend your materialistic horizon through
 healthy and valueful thoughts and feelings to an extent that you can find the truth and reality in yourselves
 and proclaim and comprehend them.

### #187 (Chapter 28)

 All the efforts of the true prophets and their teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the life
 are of no benefit, if you do not let their knowledge and wisdom get through to you, because even the basic
 thoughts of all truth-strivings have become purely materialistic in you.

### #188 (Chapter 28)

 And if the true prophets come with the ‹Goblet of the Truth› as intermediaries between you truth-straying
 human beings and the truth of the creational laws and recommendations, then you shall think about the
 ‹Teaching of the Prophets› and build up energy and power in you, so that the truth of the teaching gets into
 you and you comprehend and follow it.

### #189 (Chapter 28)

 You are still only a few amongst you, you who, as ones stricken by the materialism, demand for the effective
 truth of all truth and search for it and you who are overbearingly insulted as opponents of the god-belief by
 the believers of the religions, sects, ideologies and philosophies, instead of them recognising the righteous-
 ness, strength of the character and the fairness as well as the responsibility and the conscientiousness in your
 efforts.
 
### #190 (Chapter 28)

 But do not let yourselves be made uncertain in your search for the truth which you find only in yourselves and
 in the creational laws and recommendations which act through all things and everything existent of the whole
 Creation, with which you too are closely connected with everything through the creational love.

### #191 (Chapter 28)

 The brazen laws and recommendations of the Creation in all its creations, i.e. in all its manifestations, in all
 created creations, and indeed in everything existent, run through, as all-embracing swinging waves, the whole
 universe and everything that exists therein; and resulting out of these law- and recommendation-based swing-
 ing waves are also the interactions through which you yourselves form and determine your destiny; it follows
 from this that you cannot set yourselves against the creational laws and recommendations without having to
 bear the consequences in accordance with cause and effect which you determine yourselves through your
 acting, even if you do not know or refuse to understand this.

### #192 (Chapter 28)

 The interaction out of your thoughts and feelings as well as out of your activity and deeds is inexorable and
 unmovable, so therefore everything always comes back to you, be it good or evil.

### #193 (Chapter 28)

 And just as the interaction that strikes you is created by and starts from yourselves, so the truth and its effect
 starts from the Creation, namely through its laws and recommendations in which everything existent of each
 kind is integrated; consider that cause and effect always belong together, they are one in themselves alone and
 one in connectedness, therefore each part can carry out autonomous deeds, but in co-operation as connection
 in the whole they result in a oneness.

### #194 (Chapter 28)

 In front of the Creation all is one, a oneness, woven through with its spiritual energy and power, however com-
 prehensive in the wise that everything is autonomous and also creates its own energy and power in itself, just
 as each thing in this wise also determines and forms everything itself, but nonetheless is connected with the
 Creation itself, with its energy and power and with the whole universe and everything that exists therein.

### #195 (Chapter 28)

 So regardless of what it is, it is always an autonomous oneness, just as the negative and positive are in them-
 selves each an autonomous oneness, but in union they again form a oneness, i.e. a whole, like for example,
 the electricity with plus and minus, i.e. positive and negative, each of which in itself is an autonomous energy
 and power and a oneness, in union however again form a whole, a oneness, so for example through the com-
 bination light is generated or motors are driven etc; this however means that there is no twofoldness, i.e. no
 duality and no threefoldness, i.e. trinity, but in each case always only a oneness, a whole.

### #196 (Chapter 28)

 And because you humankind who have gone astray do not understand these things with regard to the cre-
 ational laws and recommendations, which act in all and each thing in the same wise, true intermediaries are
 given to you, true proclaimers of the truth, so that you may learn and free yourselves from the chains of the
 truth-unknowledgeness in order to follow the truth of all truth and the reality of all reality.

### #197 (Chapter 28)

 The true prophets come in order to make the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life comprehensible to you, so that you learn thereout and lead a life in accordance with the laws and
 recommendations of the Creation and fulfil the consciousness-evolution as life-sense.

### #198 (Chapter 28)

 But it is not clear to many amongst you human beings of Earth what the truth of all truth is, nor is it clear to
 you what the Creation and the reality are; for the majority amongst you, truth, Creation and reality are confus-
 ing terms which you equate with your belief in a god, tin god or a human being raised to a godly idol.

### #199 (Chapter 28)

 But know: Truth, Creation and reality are themselves practising love, fairness, harmony, peace and freedom,
 because these values are based in and carried in the unmovable and unbribable laws and recommendations of
 the Creation itself and pulse through the entire universe.

### #200 (Chapter 28)

 The love in particular is the fundamental factor of all being of the whole Creation, as everything is created out
 of the Creation itself, out of the Universal Consciousness; and so, just as through the Creation everything is
 bound in love, so should it also be amongst you human beings of Earth, namely that you embrace everything
 in love, your next ones, all your fellow human beings and the whole humankind, the nature and its plant-
 world, the planet, the animals, all creatures and everything that crawls and flies; but you only embrace your-
 selves in your ausgeartet, selfish self-love, whereas you bring only apparent love to your next ones, your fellow
 human beings as well as your humankind.

### #201 (Chapter 28)

 You band together in apparent love for the friendship, do not even know the true parent- and sibling-love any-
 more, nor the love for the next ones but only the doubtful imperiousness-love, immodesty-love, the stinginess-
 love and pathological egoism-love as well as the obsession-love for riches, for money, for self-benefit and
 worldly pleasures.

### #202 (Chapter 28)

 And you many amongst you who enter into purposeful marital bonds, you do not even know the true bond-
 love, but only a purposeful love which is based in winning financial riches or idol-like estimation, so without
 true love you enter in doubtfulness into a marital bond, and, according to whim and pathological need, you
 break it again, through which neither a permanence nor true love can come about.

### #203 (Chapter 28)

 Just as you only have an apparent love to the truth, so you only feel an apparent love to your life whose high
 value you disregard and which you constantly drive to the edge of the death through all sorts of extreme and
 irresponsible forms of the activity and deeds.
 
### #204 (Chapter 28)

 All around, the love is for very many of you, those who only cultivate it as illusion, lies and deception, only
 directed towards profit, riches, estimation, self-presentation, advantages, harm, spitefulness, hostility and mali-
 ciousness, which is why you feign love in characterlessness, whereas there is truthly only hatred, greed, schaden-
 freude, pathological craving for revenge and urge for retaliation as well as rapacity, pathological craving for
 profit and exploitation in you.

### #205 (Chapter 28)

 Just as you have made your invented gods, tin gods and idolised human beings to religions, ideologies and
 philosophies and to a belief, so you have done the same with the love, because for you it is nothing more than
 a belief and a religion which, just like the supposed love, you also bend and maltreat for your own purpose
 depending on your requirements and attitude.

### #206 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you have completely wrongly understood the love and have, through a wide variety of falsifications and
 distortions, made it into a term of belief and religion, although you know not at all what real love is, because
 you make it dependent on material things and you exchange it on a whim like dirty shirts.

### #207 (Chapter 28)

 What you call love is everything but love, because true love is the deepest spiritual-fine-sensitive-feeling-based
 connectedness, and love is the absolute certainty of oneself living together and coexisting with everything in
 everything, thus, in all that exists; in fauna and flora, in the fellow human being, in every material and spiritual
 life form irrespective of its kind, and in the existence of the entire universe and much more (laws and recom-
 mendations).

### #208 (Chapter 28)

 But you amongst you human beings of Earth who have the love as belief and religion, if one goes to the true
 bottom of your so-called real love, then nothing remains in the end but desires, comfort, imagination, vanity,
 longing for riches and estimation, avarice as well as sexual drives etc.

### #209 (Chapter 28)

 Truthful love is not only thought- and feeling-conditioned but raised through spiritual fine-sensitive feelings out of the Gemüt of the spirit-realm, and this form of the true love is not simply directed towards what you like,
what is pleasant for you and what brings you joy and a comfortable feeling, but rather it directs itself only
according to what joins together with deepest connectedness and certainty of the co-existence in harmony.

### #210 (Chapter 28)

 True love is also true joy and all-embracing happiness in togetherness in the thoughts, feelings and in the psyche,
 in which every servility, submissiveness and hypocrisy is excluded; if it is said through the true prophets “Love
 your enemies”, then this means that you shall cultivate a deep connectedness in certainty of the co-existence,
 and indeed irrespective of whether your real or apparent enemy openly perceives this or not.

### #211 (Chapter 28)

 Beware of disciplining your real or apparent enemies in order to move them to the cognition, but instead let
 them know that you are not hostile-minded to them and that as human beings you feel deeply connected with
 them and that you bear neither hatred nor revenge-thoughts against them; this alone is love and the cultiva-
 tion of the fairness to the next one and fellow human being, because consider, that true love cannot be sepa-
 rated from fairness, because both belong together, each as its own oneness, and together they again build a
 oneness.

### #212 (Chapter 28)

 Fairness and the being-fair in love require, however, that you do not show inappropriate indulgence to a hostile-
 minded one so that his or her misbehaviour is not increased and that he or she does not go further down the
 slanting track, because truly it is your duty to point out the misbehaviour in love, intellect and rationality as well
 as in a peaceful wise in order to not, contrary to the love, bring guilt and hatred upon yourselves.

### #213 (Chapter 28)

 The love of many of you human beings of Earth, those who have made it into the belief and into the religion,
 ideology or philosophy, you also form it through your unspoken wishes into unworthiness and inertness, and
 in doing so you deny and defame it in its truthliness, and indeed in the same wise as you do this with the true
 truth-bringers, the prophets, the proclaimers and defame them by accusing them of being weak and indul-
 gent, because they do not preach hatred, war, terror, revenge and retaliation, but teach you of the true love,
 harmony and freedom and real peace.

### #214 (Chapter 28)

 The sadness which often befalls the true prophets has nothing to do with weakness and indulgence and is an
 implicitness for the proclaimers with regard to their high mission and the humankind they are confronted with,
 with which they must come to terms against all defamatory and life-threatening attacks of the antagonists
 who have fallen pray to hatred.

### #215 (Chapter 28)

 But you, those you who do not search for the belief of love nor for the religion of love but for the true love
 out of spiritual-fine-sensitive feelings, you must liberate yourselves from all dogmatic restrictions and in strict
 consequence and without any illogical indulgence and weakness turn to the creational laws and recommen-
 dations and follow them, because it is alone by fulfilling them that you are able to find and build up the true
 love in you; be always conscious that true love is no coercion, but must be created and become reality from
 out of your own free will.

### #216 (Chapter 28)

 Your free will is something special, but in order to be able to explain it, a number of external things must be
 considered which more or less have an influence on it; in addition, the free will is something about which there
 is contention even among academics.
 
### #217 (Chapter 28)

 Your free will absolutely includes your free decision- and determination-possibility which is built up upon the
 responsibility of the laws with regard to fairness.

### #218 (Chapter 28)

 Even if you ask where the free will is in your case, because you believe in godly or tin-godly guidance, prede-
 termination, providence and in the influences of the stars, in godly or tin godly punishment or in a karma and
 believe that you, whether you want it or not, are guided or pushed through the life through the powers of a
 god, tin god or a human being raised to a godly idol, this free will is nevertheless given to you, even if you do
 not want to understand this.

### #219 (Chapter 28)

 You fall seriously upon everything with fervour which talks about the free will, recognising rightly that it is pre-
 cisely here that an explanation is required, because the whole of your free will is not understood through the
 religious, ideological and philosophical belief and is also denied through the irrational assumptions and irrational
 teachings of the neo-neurology.

### #220 (Chapter 28)

 But as long as you do not have the truth of the explanation with regard to your free will, you are not able to
 properly adjust to following the creational laws and recommendations and to assert yourselves in the whole
 all-embracing Creation as that which you really are, namely human beings with a free will.

### #221 (Chapter 28)

 If you, however, do not find the right attitude in the realm of the whole all-embracing Creation and to the
 Creation, i.e. the Universal Consciousness itself, then you remain far from everything existent that it has created
 and errantly wander about therein without finding the true direction of the life; this is a state in which you find
 no destination-consciousness, because you do not unfold your free will, and as a result let yourselves be pushed,
 formed, directed, planed and errantly wander about through the life through your fellow human beings.

### #222 (Chapter 28)

 Your great deficiency with regard to your own free will is that you do not know and do not even have the faintest
 idea where in you it is actually located and how it works; this fact alone shows that you have interrupted the
 connection to your free will and that you have most widely lost it and that therefore you no longer know where
 and how you can find it.

### #223 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you have closed the gate to the cognition and to the understanding of your free will through your purely
 materialistic good of thoughts and good of feelings, so you undecidedly turn around in a circle and continu-
 ously wear yourselves out when you search for the truth and for your free will.

### #224 (Chapter 28)

 Only when you change your thoughts and feelings and you uprightly strive after the effective truth and also
 want to find it through your free will, will fresh energy and power come about in you in order to open your
 closedness; but be certain that even if you scour away your closedness with great power, the way to the truth
 will still be long and you will have to continue searching steadily.

### #225 (Chapter 28)

 You must learn to find the way of the truth in yourselves which is the truth and the culmination-point itself, and so you must learn to go the way and to tread it with a steady and unswerving step, otherwise it can happen
that you indeed see the way, but stagger and stumble along it and keep falling again and again, because you
are slightly impaired and make missteps, and as a result you can neither find the real truth nor your free will.

### #226 (Chapter 28)

 You many amongst you who are simple, hardworking and normal-common Earth-humans without any aca-
 demic titles, ranks and names and believers with regard to a godhead, a tin god, angel, saint or idolised human
 being, but also you amongst you who do have high titles, ranks and names, for example as scientist or neu-
 rologists etc., you show uncomprehension towards the real presence, i.e. the true existence of your free will in
 a hard-headed wise, and this in total non-understanding of what the free will really is.

### #227 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, the simple explanation for the free will is already given in the expression itself, but because you are com-
 plicated in your rationality and in your intellect, you also see the explanation in complicatedness, and the reason
 for this is that you are not able to perceive the really simple precisely because it is so simple, and therefore you
 look for the free will – of which you cannot make neither a picture nor an idea – in the wrong place.

### #228 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth who make yourselves thoughts about your free will, you live in imaginations which
 are in any case always wrong, because imaginations correspond always to illusions, and illusions are nothing
 but wish-pictures, imaginations, castles in the air, worthless things, and self-deception and they have nothing
 to do with the truth and reality; the only things that can be right are effective reference-points, terms, pictures
 and ideas which correspond to the reality but never to imaginations.

### #229 (Chapter 28)

 But because you do make yourselves imaginations which are always wrong and bring disappointments, you also try to explain your own free will through an erroneous imagination that is based therein, that a Gewalt-
based construction of your brain forces your space and time bound intellect and the rationality to push the
thoughts and feelings in any distinct direction and to determine them; this, however, is a heavy-weighing con-
foundedness and in no wise corresponds to your free will, but rather is a self-thought-up wrong machination
of your not-understood will which is bound to your inadequate intellect and to the inadequate rationality.

### #230 (Chapter 28)

 This grave confoundedness creates great erroneous assumptions and builds up a wall against the truth which
 makes a recognising and realising of the same impossible for you; and that you therefore, also find gaps and
 contradictions while searching for your free will and are not able to bring logicalness, i.e. logic into the whole,
 that surprises you tremendously and closes off your intellect and the rationality.

### #231 (Chapter 28)

 Your free will is truthly exceedingly drastically connected with the fine-fluidal world of the nature of your indi-
 viduality which you are capable of forming yourselves and upon which your will puts its stamp.

### #232 (Chapter 28)

 Your free will stands in direct connection with your consciousness and therewith also with your thoughts and
 feelings and consequently also with your brain as well as with the fine-fluidal realm.

### #233 (Chapter 28)

 Were you not to always grant the suzerainty, i.e. the higher ruling only to your material intellect and to the
 therewith connected rationality in an unrestricted wise, but were also to use the core of your true inner nature
 which is connected with your own fine-fluidal side, then you would be able to recognise your free will and
 control it consciously.

### #234 (Chapter 28)

 And were you to use and control your free will consciously, then you would recognise the fine-fluidal of the
 core of your inner nature as your real ego and thus fundamentally determine everything yourselves in complete
 freedom and in a fully conscious wise and absolutely free of any influences, and this self-determination alone
 is the crucial factor of your free will.

### #235 (Chapter 28)

 And if you use your self-determination i.e. your free will, then you will not live in that bound will which, to
 execute all material purposes, is bound to the earthly space and time and which is determined through your
 life-mode, life-circumstances, the norms of the society, through requirements, wishes, desires and orders of the
 fellow human beings as well as through laws and ordinances etc.

### #236 (Chapter 28)

 The bound will is that which is not self-created but which affects you through external, material influences and
 suppresses your own free will and does not let it come to fruition, and this is why you then assume that you
 do not have your own free will.

### #237 (Chapter 28)

 But if you live with it by only following your bound will, then you do not consciously determine your destiny
 in the wise that it solely and exclusively comes from you and is formed by you, but instead you determine it by
 acquiring external influences and bending to the bound will that is having an effect on you and bringing about
 in this kind and wise your destiny yourselves.

### #238 (Chapter 28)

 Of course, this explanation does not lead to a true comprehension concerning your free will as human beings,
 because in order to really understand it, it is necessary to know what the free will is fundamentally based on,
 and the reason for that is anchored in the creational laws and recommendations which are laid out solely on
 the determination of effects in accordance with the causal law of cause and effect.

### #239 (Chapter 28)

 These laws and recommendations which are formed in fairness are not determining in what you as human
 beings shall do or refrain from doing through them, as a result of which you would be without free will and
 determiningly controlled through them, because to the contrary they do not determine any of your thoughts,
 feelings, deeds and actions, but instead let you determine and decide over them in every respect yourselves,
 and hence in accordance with your own free will.

### #240 (Chapter 28)

 What is pregiven through the laws and recommendations of the Creation are only the effects, namely that cer-
 tain causes bring about certain effects; thus, it is only laid down through the laws and recommendations that
 certain thoughts, feelings, actions, deeds and modes of functioning as cause, bring about with absolute cer-
 tainty effects corresponding to the cause, in which case you as human beings, however, are free according to
 your own will to form the cause in the right or wrong, i.e. negative or positive wise and hence to bring about
 a right or wrong, i.e. a positive or negative, i.e. good or bad effect.

### #241 (Chapter 28)

 As a vague example, you can use your self-created laws and ordinances etc. which are given to you in the wise that you can follow them or act contrary to them according to your own choosing, i.e. according to your own
free decision and according to your free will; this means that your laws and ordinances etc. are so formed that
you can follow them or disregard them, and they are also based on cause and effect; if you follow them, you
create therewith good, positive causes, out of which the effect of the impunity comes and a life-conduct based
on the law-following results, one that is rightful, irreproachable, righteous, fairness-formed and responsible
and therefore of a good and positive nature; if, on the contrary, you disregard and break your laws and ordi-
nances, then that results in the effect of the punishability and a life-conduct of the unright, irresponsibility, un -
fairness and unrighteousness which corresponds to an ungood and negative form; and whether your thoughts,
feelings, deeds, actions and your activity shall be good and positive or bad and negative is something you your-
selves decide according to your own choosing and in the full possession of your free will, because also with
regard to the following or non-following of your civil and criminal laws, recommendations and ordinances you
are not forced to keep to them and follow them, just as is the case with the creational laws and recommen-
dations; you just have to bear the effects that arise out of your self-determined causes, i.e. thoughts, feelings,
actions and deeds, be it in relation to the creational or your human laws and recommendations, i.e. ordinances.

### #242 (Chapter 28)

 With regard to both the creational laws and recommendations as well as your human laws and ordinances you
 are free in deciding whether you want to follow them or disregard them, in which case you are also con-
 scious – at least with regard to your earthly-human laws and ordinances etc. – that the cause of a breach of
 the law or ordinance will entail the effect of you being called to account.

### #243 (Chapter 28)

 You can decide yourselves, according to your own free will, whether or not you want to keep to the laws and
 recommendations of the Creation or your earthly-human laws and ordinances, because you are not compelled
 through them to act in the one or other wise, thus you decide yourselves what good or bad causes you want
 to choose and create and what laudable or evil effects you want to call forth, and you do this entirely accord-
 ing to your own free will through which you determine yourselves your integration into the good or bad.

### #244 (Chapter 28)

 As a rule, you are not able to recognise in what wise the very often many-sided entanglement of your thoughts,
 feelings, actions, deeds and your activity cover the effects of your free will, because you only live in accordance
 with your superficiality and do not really perceive what fundamentally happens in you, and as a result you can-
 not analyse your own free will, nor do you recognise, let alone understand it, which is why you wrongly as-
 sume that you do not willingly control everything yourselves but instead would be controlled through cosmic
 or godly laws.

### #245 (Chapter 28)

 In order to understand the whole of your free will, you must go back to the fine-fluidal shell of your free con-
 sciousness and to the core of your inner nature which form the outer edge of the substantialness into which
 the energy and power of the spiritual sinks in an impulse-based wise, transferred through your spirit-form as
 well as through the creational laws and recommendations; and this is what you shall be striving for to perceive,
 because then you will realise that you are not at all what you imagine yourselves to be.

### #246 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you human beings of Earth do not have the absolute right to the glory of the life, because the right solely
 consists in you earning it through the evolution of your consciousness by creating in you and around you true
 love, harmony, freedom and peace as well as knowledge and wisdom and leading your life rightfully in fair-
 ness, conscientiousness, righteousness and responsibility; and this also says that the whole of that which you
 assume in your incorrectly understood or conceived sense, namely that you are from the ground up true human
 beings, is entirely wrong, because you are true human beings only when you have developed into them.

### #247 (Chapter 28)

 Fundamentally, you are only sown into the life as human-seed and as this seed you carry everything in you in
 order to personally consciously develop yourselves into a true human being, but the prerequisite is given that
 you yourselves create and cultivate the thereto required capabilities and possibilities in you, bring them to a
 high-form and not let them wither again.

### #248 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, this process of the self-development happens in accordance with your completely free will and in con-
 nection with the creation of the capabilities and possibilities, and the entire process is tremendously big,
 immense and completely natural in every step of the happening; and for this you are given the creational-spir-
 itual energy and power through which you can, according to your own free will, choose a logical or illogical
 developmental process, so you decide yourselves whether you want to follow the logical, creational laws and
 recommendations or not and thus want to bring down fortune or unfortune on you; but consider, also the
 logic is not absolutely fully developed, rather only in a relative kind and wise, and indeed because there is always
 only relatively absolute full-development, because each development entails another development, each result
 another result, and indeed entirely in accordance with the law of the causality, that a cause brings forth a
 distinct effect which in turn is the cause for a further effect etc.

### #249 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth, as human-seed, each of you carries in himself or herself a Creation-given sprit-form
 which animates you and your entire consciousness-block with creational-spiritual energy and power and through
 which you are capable of taking in the cosmic-electromagnetic life energy; and through the same energy and
 power you are also enabled to create all necessary capabilities and possibilities in you, and each one of them
 carries in it a promise whose fulfilment will absolutely occur, if you form everything thereto through your will,
 i.e. if you bring your self-created capabilities and possibilities to the realisation.

### #250 (Chapter 28)

 Learn that the high-fine-fluidal of the Creation gets into the inner nature of your fine-fluidal as energy and
 power, and from this, your own fine-fluidal, it undulates into your consciousness and your body, through which
 you as material human life form also carry creational-spiritual energy and power in you; and through the high-
 fine-fluidal of the Creation, which gets into your fine-fluidal and out of this into your consciousness and into
 your body, you live and evolve in your consciousness, if you learn in a conscious or unconscious wise.

### #251 (Chapter 28)

 The seed of your consciousness-evolution germinates and grows only slowly, and indeed in accordance with
 your conscious efforts which you must specially create through your free will; but if you do not develop the
 necessary capabilities and possibilities consciously and willingly, then your efforts will deteriorate and peter out
 somewhere without them bringing any success and being able to realise themselves.

### #252 (Chapter 28)

 But if you consciously willingly strive for everything necessary, then the capabilities and possibilities arise in you
 which you accurately sort and weed out that which is of no value, so you split off the chaff from the good
 corn.
 
### #253 (Chapter 28)

 On the whole, this is the way of the developmental process in which your free will is recognisable, but in order
 to recognise it, the actual developmental process of you human beings of Earth must be followed a bit more
 deeply, because the fact is that you can, in accordance with your wishes, requirements and desires, change the
 course of your thoughts and feelings simply according to your free choosing, i.e. your free will, and give it a
 new direction, if something doesn't please you any more; but through this you also ripen more and more,
 because slowly your differentiation-ability and also your discernment grow which ultimately leads to the fact
 that you become more conscious and more secure and follow a distinct direction; and the choice of the direc-
 tion, the way, the swinging waves which you are willing to follow will not then remain without a deeper effect
 in yourselves, and thereby it is only logical that the direction that you choose, the way that you go, and the
 swinging waves in which you pulsate in your free will, create an interaction which influences you.

### #254 (Chapter 28)

 The pure creational energy and power which you take in through your fine-fluidal-realm in your consciousness and in the entire consciousness-block is pure and noble in itself, and you shall also use the consciousness in
this kind and wise according to your free will and not let it wither through the bound, worldly-material will.

### #255 (Chapter 28)

 If you mainly follow your own noble swinging waves, your own good- or best-formed ideas, thoughts, feel-
 ings, determinations and decisions, then you therethrough form your free will logically in the right form of the
 positive, good and valueful which finds expression in you yourselves just as you also carry it forth outwards
 through your words, actions, deeds and your activity in general.

### #256 (Chapter 28)

 If you mainly decide through your ideas, thoughts, feelings, determinations and decisions for the ignoble
 swinging waves, then these, over time, influence your free will in such a wise that the negative, bad, and evil
 kind adheres to it, through which also your individuality becomes formed in the same wise, and you direct your
 actions, deeds and all your activity thereupon; the reason for this is that the solely negative, bad and evil over-
 grows everything, as a result of which no awakening and blossoming to the effective truth can occur.

### #257 (Chapter 28)

 If you form your free will to the purely evil, negative, bad, unrighteous, irresponsible, to the consciencelessness
 and to the unfair, then you bury and suppress in you the creationally formed core of your inner nature while
 you form its outer nature through your free will into a bad individuality, through which you become a terrible
 administrator of your creational good which you carry in the core of your inner nature as creational-spiritual
 form, energy and power.

### #258 (Chapter 28)

 The core of your inner nature is formed through the creational nature, i.e. its energy and power, with which
 you shall live in conformity and therethrough form the outer shell to the best through your own efforts and
 according to your own free will, because this outer shell of the core of your inner nature is given to you as fun-
 damentally neutral, so that you yourselves can form it as individuality; however, if you carry out this forming
 process in a wrong wise, by willingly preferring only the evil, bad and negative, then firstly your will forms itself
 out of your own, free decision and determination, and secondly out of this results an individuality which is
 equivalent to this free will.

### #259 (Chapter 28)

 The energy and power of the will which is given you from birth onwards is fundamentally neutral and as such
 lies dormant, therefore it can be worked on and so to speak be programmed like a computer; but this means
 that you yourselves determine the form of your will, that is whether it shall be really free in accordance with
 your desire or whether you enslave it and leave it to the outer boundedness, through which it withers and you
 are enslaved by the bound will which is dictated upon you.

### #260 (Chapter 28)

 This means that you can build up your own free will and therethrough regulate, decide and determine all things
 of your life yourselves, or you can let your material environment and your fellow human beings forcefully impose
 their will, the bound one, upon you, because truly you yourselves decide how your will shall be formed, and
 indeed in the negative, bad, evil as well as in the positive, good, best and valueful.

### #261 (Chapter 28)

 It follows that you can form and raise your will in full and ample freedom for yourselves, just as you can direct
 it also into the boundedness and unfreedom of the sinking into the purely substantial, i.e. material and let it
 wither.

### #262 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore it is possible for you to form your swinging waves freely in accordance with your ideas, thoughts,
 feelings, decisions and determinations, whether you create your own positive, good or negative and bad free
 will, or whether you want to let a bound, unfree will be forcefully imposed upon you from the outside.

### #263 (Chapter 28)

 If you choose the negative, bad, evil side of the free will, then you will constantly be exposed to the same kind
 of temptations and besmirch yourselves therewith if you follow them; in this wise, a consciousness-based rest-
 lessness stirs in you which expresses itself through thoughts and feelings and therefore through the psyche;
 indeed also the external effects result in the same wise through the purely negative, bad and evil and no longer
 give any room for the noble, because the latter is overgrown, as is the free will which in its negative or positive
 form is dependent on your own decisions and determinations, ideas, thoughts and feelings and formed through
 them.
 
### #264 (Chapter 28)

 And know, you human beings of Earth, each guilt that strikes you and each destiny that is connected with you
 is of a purely substantial nature, because such is only given within the material creation, i.e. the created cre-
 ations which have come out of the idea of the Creation Universal Consciousness; therefore only as human
 beings can you load guilt and destiny onto you, whereas your spirit, i.e. your sprit-form, which is of creational
 nature and is only a minuscule part in you, cannot be befallen thereby; so nothing of guilt and destiny can pass
 over to your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form as pure creational energy and power, and also nothing of guilt and destiny
 can connect to it in any wise; therefore only you can – in accordance with your free will – load guilt onto you
 and bring about a distinct own destiny, in which case you can however also liberate yourselves from your guilt
 again and developmentally change your destiny in accordance with your own free will; this fact does not over-
 turn anything but confirms only the truth which is given through the creational laws and recommendations;
 but this truth contradicts the religious belief and the religiously given irrational teachings in which the great
 truth of all truth can no longer be recognised as it has been given to you earthly humankind through the true
 prophets, through the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, the ‹Goblet of the Truth› which is the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit and the teaching of the life.

### #265 (Chapter 28)

 The more conscious you human beings of Earth become and progress in your evolution, the more the outer
 shell of your creationally determined inner nature takes on its form, as a result of which your individuality forms
 itself in accordance with the core of your inner nature, just as your free will develops according to your there-
 with growing individuality, through which your free will and your individuality jointly work together in the same
 form.

### #266 (Chapter 28)

 But if you do not let the shell of your inner nature develop in accordance with the creational kind of the core
 of your inner nature and you do not strive for the noble and for the characteristic nature of the core, then your
 individuality and your will will accordingly form themselves in a negative, bad or evil wise, because in the same
 wise that you strive for the noble or ignoble, so will the effect be, noble or ignoble.

### #267 (Chapter 28)

 From the very beginning onwards the free will is given you, and therefore you can make it, through your own
 decisions and determinations, negative, bad, evil or positive, good and noble, so you can also form it to the
 full freedom or boundedness.

### #268 (Chapter 28)

 In any case, it is always up to you whether you let your free will exist as such and use it consciously, intellec-
 tually and rationally in a logical wise or whether you make it bound, i.e. unfree and burdened with external
 influences, so that it is so much disadvantaged that it no longer corresponds to a free will in any wise.

### #269 (Chapter 28)

 In the Creation, in the Universal Consciousness, and in all its created creations and in everything existent that
 it has created, one wheel of the happening interlocks into the other; in strict logicalness one thing is the con-
 sequence of another thing and at the same time controllingly turns everything that is connected with it,
 through which no irregularity can occur; the whole is like a gigantic giant-wheelwork, in which from all sides
 the cogs of the wheels precisely and sharply interlock and incessantly move everything further and drive it for-
 wards to the development; and you human beings of Earth, you stand with the decision- and determination-
 power given to you through your free will in the middle of this immense machinery, equipped with an unmea-
 surable might which is given you and with which you are able to direct the big wheelwork of your own life
 and destiny in any direction that you choose, that is to your own prosperity or adversity, to your fortune or
 unfortune, to the negative, bad, evil, terrible or to the positive, good, depending on how you form and use
 your free will.

### #270 (Chapter 28)

 And truly, whatever you do in this respect you only do for yourselves, because you alone lead yourselves
 upwards or downwards, because for every cause and effect your free will is always the decisive factor, depend-
 ing on how you form it through your own attitude, decision and determination.

### #271 (Chapter 28)

 Just as the whole wheelwork of the machinery of the Creation does not consist of rigid material but of living
 forms, created creations and natures, so your own wheelwork of your inner nature and your entire conscious-
 ness-block is full of vitality and creates the immense effect of your existence.

### #272 (Chapter 28)

 And your marvellous own wheelwork of your inner nature and your consciousness-block is directed towards
 helping you human beings of Earth and bringing you forward in your evolution, consciously and through your
 own will, and indeed as long as you do not squander the might given to you in an intellect- and rationality-
 less childish wise, use it wrongly and throw it into the wheelwork of your own machinery as something defec-
 tive and thus hold back or even destroy everything.

### #273 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore it is recommended to you to finally integrate yourselves into the creational laws and recommenda-
 tions, so that you finally become what you shall be, namely real and true human beings.

### #274 (Chapter 28)

 To integrate oneself into the creational laws and recommendations in reality means nothing more than under-
 standing their effects and acting through one's own decision and determination in free will; but this in turn
 means that you help yourselves, in which case this helping is based in your own decision to determine every-
 thing yourselves, to rule over everything and thus to make the own will free, namely to the free will, exactly
 as it has to be; and that again is a crucial point, because if you follow this guidance, you will change every-
 thing for you, because you change inwardly first.
 
### #275 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you are thousands of millions of Earth-humans, and as a huge mass you actually want a better and good
 life, but as majority of your humankind, you let yourselves be deceived and guided into the unreal through
 false teachings of the religions, ideologies and philosophies, far from any creational law- and recommendation-
 based truth; thus it is only natural that you do not know the Creation-given laws and recommendations and
 that you cannot follow them, through which you disturb the wheelwork of the happenings around you and
 your own destiny and shatter many things that are good and valueful, before they can even arise.

### #276 (Chapter 28)

 And if you do not rightfully search, trembling and anxious, for the way of the truth in you which is itself the
 truth and the culmination-point, then you hesitate and fall back into your belief in your god, tin god or idolised
 human being, through which you again bethink yourselves of the praying, begging and beseeching to them
 and submissively pay homage to them, but because you have already got involved with the truth to a certain
 degree, you no longer find a way back to the earlier kind of your belief and waver between the world of the
 creational truth and the world of the religious, sectarian, ideological or philosophical lie and guidance into the
 unreal, so you definitively do not find the truth which could bring you help.

### #277 (Chapter 28)

 If you then recognise your failure, you fall into despair and go quickly enraged over to the swearing and to the
 alleging accusation that there is neither any truthly truth and no effects of the creational laws and recommen-
 dations, nor, above all, any Creation, if it lets such things happen; but in your rage you forget that it is not the
 Creation and not its laws and recommendations that are responsible for you, but only you all alone with your
 own free will through which you determine and bring about all and everything that befalls you in terms of hap-
 penings and the destiny.

### #278 (Chapter 28)

 And because you do not recognise, in all the things of your thoughts and feelings as well as in your general
 effects and in all your actions and deeds, your own responsibility and the own free will through which you con-
 duct, decide, determine, form, create and call into the life everything yourselves, so you also do not find the
 iron strength of the character and of all virtues in everything as is given through the creational laws and recom-
 mendations; nor do you recognise the might of your own decision- and determination-capability and there-
 with of your free will through which you can change everything to the good and best and to the valueful and
 most valueful; truly, this has been said to you again and again since time immemorial through all true prophets,
 but you do not want to listen and to act correctly.

### #279 (Chapter 28)

 You do not want to listen and act, but with childish defiance you demand fairness and forgiveness, even though
 you do not know who shall give them to you; and if you assume that the Creation Universal Consciousness
 shall give you fairness and forgiveness and you then intend to accept it in its greatness and truth, then you are
 on an evil irrational way, because truly, you alone are responsible for the fairness and forgiveness, because in
 your life you yourselves must give them to you, since you alone are responsible for all and everything for which
 you need fairness and forgiveness.

### #280 (Chapter 28)

 Consider: How and what should the Creation do for you according to your imaginations, you who demand
 fairness and forgiveness from it, given the fact that not the Creation is responsible for your thoughts and feel-
 ings, for all your activity as well as your actions and deeds, but you alone?; truly, you mock the Creation, the
 Universal Consciousness, with your belief in a god, tin god, angel, devil, saint or human being raised to a godly
 or other idol, and nevertheless you have the audacity to demand fairness and forgiveness from it – what a
 characterlessness and degradation.

### #281 (Chapter 28)

 Most amongst you human beings of Earth, you who are fools, in your always newly self-wanted blindness,
 imperiousness, boastfulness and deafness you run into your ruin which, through your wrong and self-right-
 eous behaviour, you create in blind zeal to your own suffering.

### #282 (Chapter 28)

 You increasingly and obstinately strive towards the wanting-to-know-everything-better, and you let yourselves
 sink deeper and deeper into the deep, dark and bottomless abyss of the truth-unknowledge.

### #283 (Chapter 28)

 Know and consider: Only by searching for the real truth in yourselves and also finding the way of the truth in
 yourselves, which is the truth and the culmination-point itself, can you come to your senses; therefore, the
 darkness of the truth-unknowledge itself shall be the beginning of the teaching for you through which you
 find the truth; consider that it can be that you perhaps find the way to the real truth of all truth too late, if
 there is not enough time for you to save you from an evil happening or destiny; let yourselves finally recognise
 the truth in yourselves, so that you may also find the real truth of the Creation and its laws and recommenda-
 tions, so that you recognise it, experience and live it and can tear yourselves loose from the darkness of your
 truth-unknowledge and rise upwards to the light of the truth; truly, it is high time for you to make yourselves
 free from your belief in a god, tin god, saint, angel, idolised human being as well as from your belief in reli-
 gions, sects, ideologies and philosophies and finally turn seriously, consciously, unrestrictedly and neutrally to
 the effective truth of all truth and work with it and make it to your knowledge and to your wisdom.

### #284 (Chapter 28)

 The wisdom is not as you human beings of Earth in large numbers and as self-appointed wise ones show it,
 even though you are by no means wise; wisdom only arises once you have, from out of your own, inner cogni-
 tion, made an effective fact your own, and therefore have made it to the living, uncoerced, incontrovertible
 and irrefutable inner knowledge, out of which the essence proceeds as wisdom.
 
### #285 (Chapter 28)

 Thus wisdom comes from out of yourselves not however out of supposed words of a god, tin god, or human
 being raised to a godly idol, nor does it come through priests, angles or saints etc.

### #286 (Chapter 28)

 True wisdom is an attestation of your own free will through which, if you consciously willingly strive for it, you
 can consciously live the becoming, the being and the passing and therewith also the truth and in this wise can
 also perceive your thoughts, feelings and spiritual fine-sensitive feelings, through which your activity will in
 every respect turn into a joyful truth-affirmation.

### #287 (Chapter 28)

 And if in you human beings of Earth the effective wisdom truthly develops as essence out of the true knowledge,
 then you become quiet and do not talk much about it, because you have become a personality of wisdom, in
 the silent trust in your truthly knowledge and your equally true wisdom which can also be called truth-trust
 with which you are in a solid and secure connection with the creational laws and recommendations as well as
 with the energy of the BEING of the Creation Universal Consciousness.

### #288 (Chapter 28)

 And if true wisdom has grown up in you, you do not float about in illusions and fantasies, just as you also do
 not get into entrancement, do not fall into any belief and do not fall into uncontrolled passions as well as
 fanaticism; going forth in true wisdom also means that you do not only live for the material, but also for the
 spiritual as well as for the evolution of your consciousness; so you fulfil, once you have created true wisdom,
 your whole earthly work at all times with fresh courage and healthy senses; and once you have created true
 wisdom in you, use it as a weapon when you are attacked; use your clear intellect and your clear rationality in
 fairness, responsibility, dignity and righteousness.

### #289 (Chapter 28)

 And even if you have awoken in true wisdom, you shall not be silent and indulgent if an unright is done to
 you and you incur disadvantage therethrough, because if you remain silent, you support and strengthen the
 evil therewith.

### #290 (Chapter 28)

 If your wisdom is great and you recognise that the unright which is being done to you is to your benefit and
 advantage, then you shall remain silent and let the unright happen, so that the benefit and advantage to you
 arises out of it.

### #291 (Chapter 28)

 You many amongst you human beings of Earth who pretend to be knowing and wise with regard to the effec- tive real truth of all truth, you are not firm in the knowledge and in the truth, because despite of your accep-
tance of the existence of the real truth, you fear the smile of the doubters and the god- and tin god-believers.

### #292 (Chapter 28)

 You who pretend to be knowing and wise but are not firm with regard to the real truth, you only simulate
 everything in order to shine with it, but truthly the deep-reaching knowledge and the real wisdom are embar-
 rassing and uncomfortable for you.

### #293 (Chapter 28)

 You are pseudo-knowing ones and pseudo-wise ones, and you go about quietly and with a meaningless facial
 expression in order to skip over every conversation which brings up the true knowledge, the truth and the wis-
 dom; or else you become embarrassed because you do not know anything concerning the real truth, hence
 you keep making concessions according to the behaviour of the doubters, believers and enquirers and tell
 them what they want to hear; but this is not knowledge and not wisdom but only falseness, hypocrisy and
 conscious denial of the reality of the truth, because fundamentally you believe in an invented god, tin god or
 idolised human being, of whom you cannot, in anxiety and fear, let go and to whom you secretly pray, beseech
 and beg and expect from them everything good and the best for you.

### #294 (Chapter 28)

 If you are halfway educated in the truth-knowledge and you nevertheless have wrong consideration for the
 truth-doubters and the god- and tin god-believers, then you cannot excuse this by saying that their case of the
 belief is too holy and too serious to them for you to give them an understanding of the real truth and explain
 it to them or that you do not want to be the butt of their derision.

### #295 (Chapter 28)

 If you act like that, then that has nothing to do with modesty but only with effective cowardice; the basic rule
 of the truth must always be that you shall always come out with it and show your knowledge and that you
 stand up for the real truth.

### #296 (Chapter 28)

 You must face every human being without fear, and indeed in dignity and in the consciousness of how this is
 the due of the truth.

### #297 (Chapter 28)

 Only then, if you openly and honestly stick to the real truth, will the doubters and believers be coerced to
 moderate themselves and to stop making you the butt of their mockery through which they betray their own
 insecurity.

### #298 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore you shall not be fearful when you turn to the truth, follow it, talk about it and give explanations; so
 be it that you do not show any fearful behaviour when you have become truthly in the true knowledge and
 you have ripened in wisdom, because consider that once fearfulness has been born, it keeps nourishing itself
 from out of itself and becomes ever more evil and immense.

### #299 (Chapter 28)

 And truly, you are very many amongst you human beings of Earth who cheat yourselves, because you con-
 found the term ‹truth› with the word ‹belief› and have therewith given an entirely different meaning to the
 truth than what the truth really requires.
 
### #300 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, the effective truth must be alive, and it is alive, and if you want to realise and comprehend it, you must
 make it to the certainty and therewith to the reality, action and activity in yourselves.

### #301 (Chapter 28)

 And once the truth has become the certainty, reality, action and activity in you, it will pervade everything, your
 thoughts and feelings, your spiritual fine-sensitive feelings and emotions as well as all your activity, actions and
 deeds.

### #302 (Chapter 28)

 The real truth of all truth must, from out of your inner, become visible in everything that belongs to you; and
 it must be unobtrusively perceptible and visible in you as well as become an implicitness.

### #303 (Chapter 28)

 And you must not hold the truth in front of you as a dummy nor as a shield, because the naturally radiating
 of your truth created in you must swing outwards and let everything become feelable and recognisable
 externally.

### #304 (Chapter 28)

 Put simply, the true inner truth of all truth is an energy and power which, radiating from your consciousness,
 interweaves your whole body and your blood and which makes the truth itself and your life to an implicitness
 for you, through which nothing artificial and enforced can take over the rule in you anymore but only the real,
 actual life.

### #305 (Chapter 28)

 Recognise yourselves still as believers, you who claim not to lead an artificial and enforced life, because truthly
 with this it is not as you claim, just as it is also not as you say, that you absolutely believe in a continued life
 after the dying, but you do not know what that continued life is like; even if you direct your thoughts and feel-
 ings upon it, you do not see it in a truthly kind and wise, but merely through your religious, sectarian, ideolog-
 ical or philosophical belief.

### #306 (Chapter 28)

 And if you should ever have the opportunity to obtain a proof of your continued life after the dying and after
 the death which goes beyond your material observation- and perception-possibilities, you would be frightened
 and shaken about the truth; because truly, your continued life after the dying and the death is not in the same
 personality, but in a completely new one which has nothing in common with the present actual one; only your
 sprit-form remains the same because it alone is, as creational energy, integrated into the reincarnation, i.e. the
 rebirth, whereas your personality ceases to be in a becoming of neutral spiritual energy out of which a new
 personality is built up which will then be born.

### #307 (Chapter 28)

 In the bottom of your truth-unknowledge, you have no certainty with regard to the otherworldly life in the
 death-life nor in the new life of the new actual personality when it is born into the new life.

### #308 (Chapter 28)

 If you had the certainty of the true facts of the life, dying, death and the rebirth, then everything would seem
 so natural to you as it really is, and this certainty would also be the proof of your continued life which con-
 tinuously occurs in another and new personality that is no longer identical with that of the former life; and if
 you have this certainty, then you will no longer be frightened and in no wise shaken over the truth of these
 things of your continued life.

### #309 (Chapter 28)

 Apart from these things of the rebirth, the life, the dying and the death, there are very many and even in-
 numerable processes in the life and death as well as in everything existent of the Creation and in its laws and
 recommendations which you do not know nor comprehend and which show with startling clarity how fright-
 eningly unknowing you are with regard to the real truth of all truth and with regard to the Creation, its laws
 and recommendations as well as its effects; truly, the knowledge about all these things is no more living in you
 than the wisdom as essence of all knowledge and the truth in itself.

### #310 (Chapter 28)

 Something that you human beings of Earth know without exception is the procreation, the birth, the life, the
 dying and the death; each one of you lives in this certainty, but this is one of the few facts about which there
 is no unknowledge at all in you and about which no strife can be kindled amongst you – except if you have
 fallen prey to a religious, sectarian, ideological or philosophical delusion and believe that you were immortal
 as material human beings.

### #311 (Chapter 28)

 If you, as material human beings, do not live in an immortality-delusion, then you must expect from childhood
 onwards that you will have to die sooner or later, but as a rule you ward off the thoughts and feelings thereon
 and push them away.

### #312 (Chapter 28)

 And there are many amongst you who have a shyness to discuss the theme life, dying and death, just as there
 are many amongst you who react very violently and indignantly if the subject comes up in your presence or
 you are confronted with it directly.

### #313 (Chapter 28)

 And you amongst you who are carefully concerned about not entering a cemetery and who shun every fu-
 neral, you try to efface your impressions, thoughts and feelings concerning the death as quickly as you can
 whenever you are somehow, through foreordination or unavoidability, confronted with the Grim Reaper.

### #314 (Chapter 28)

 In you there is always a secret angst that all of a sudden you could be struck by the death, and at the same time an undefined fear prevents you from spending serious thoughts and feelings in order to face the unalter -
able fact in full consciousness, namely that your current life is limited and that you will sooner or later inevita-
bly die and go into the death-life which, through religious, ideological and philosophical irrational teachings,
is so wrongly explained to you that you can understand nothing at all of it, let alone get closer to the truth even by a speck of dust of a weight.

### #315 (Chapter 28)

 In your life, you human beings of Earth, there is hardly any other happening which you make worse than the
 death, about which you push aside every thought and every feeling.

### #316 (Chapter 28)

 But apart from the death, there is also the preceding dying which you do not dare think about and push away
 everything related to it; but also with regard to the procreation and the birth you make no or hardly any
 thoughts and feelings, because you normally simply procreate thoughtlessly and take birth as implicitness, even
 though either is a significant process in which a very great responsibility is laid and which requires a great con-
 scientiousness.

### #317 (Chapter 28)

 It is terrifying to see that you occupy yourselves so little with the fundamental beginning and the unavoidable
 end of your earthly existence, and if you do at some time occupy yourselves with it in an attack of must-do,
 then only in anxiety or fear and with creeps; and this while you thoroughly occupy yourselves with other and
 insignificant and irrelevant processes and things, such as with your pathological craving for pleasure, the mate-
 rial joys, wishes, passions and desires etc. to which you attach an extremely great importance.

### #318 (Chapter 28)

 You research and ruminate over various kinds of unnecessary things, over your riches, your self-elevation above
 your next ones and fellow human beings as well as over countless useless things and excessive apparent joys
 of your life, but not over what would bring you clarification with regard to the fundamental beginning and the
 unavoidable end of your earthly existence.

### #319 (Chapter 28)

 Procreation, birth, life, dying, death and rebirth of the spirit-form, together with a continually new personality,
 are very closely connected to each other, because one thing is the consequence of the other, but you do not
 take the whole thing seriously, instead you irresponsibly live only for the day; out of this, you create in you
 pathological cravings, vices, hatred and unpeace as well as unfreedom and disharmony in order to live out
 everything externally and to let it pervert into bloody and destructive wars, as you learn this through the sense-
 less and irrational teachings in your belief in a god, tin god or idolised human being, and live from day to day
 in pure egoism and imperiousness, and irresponsibly procreate offspring beyond all measure and therethrough
 bring about immense catastrophes.

### #320 (Chapter 28)

 Already for the procreation of offspring you do not attribute the appropriate seriousness and responsibility, so
 you do everything only for the sake of the sexual pleasure, as a result only in rare cases are intellect and ratio-
 nality, responsibility and some degree of human dignity to be found thereby.

### #321 (Chapter 28)

 And truly, when you many amongst you human beings of Earth look at yourselves, you who live out in this
 wise and do not carry out the procreation-act in full responsibility in every wise, but only for the sake of your
 lack of intelligence, sexual greed and unconcernedness, then you delight in putting yourselves on a par with
 apes, namely the bonobos and chimpanzees, which only lie with each other for the sake of the pure sexual
 lust, and they do this in a harmlessness to which you, in your irresponsible acting, do not come close; as a
 result of this, you all amongst you who act in this kind and wise, you put yourselves below the ape creatures
 which act in accordance with the low development level that they hold.

### #322 (Chapter 28)

 And you amongst you human beings of Earth who are not able or because of your free will are not wanting
 to integrate yourselves as human individual into your appropriate level of the higher consciousness-based
 development, which is above that of the apes; you have sunk deeply and continue to go down further, so you
 must not be surprised that it is always getting worse and worse and more catastrophic with your whole
 humankind and with all your various relationships, and indeed also with the interpersonal ones, and that you,
 in your being human in the real and true sense, precipitate steeper and steeper and faster and faster into the
 abyss of the depravity.

### #323 (Chapter 28)

 Look at the customs of your bond-bindings, when you espouse each other, be it between man and woman,
 woman and woman or man and man, because everything is directed only towards seeing the bond merely as
 a matter without any responsibility and obligation, which, moreover, can be dissolved at any time according to
 your desire and mood, if the one partner has had enough of the other, if money- or other problems arise or if
 the two spouses grow apart or if there is a marital breakdown; the fact that children are procreated or adopted
 in such bonds, who in the whole process are the main victims and as a result often become human beings who
 are asocial or forlorn in themselves, that does not worry you amongst you human beings of Earth who belong
 to those unfair, irresponsible, conscienceless and non-righteous ones who go forth in this kind and wise in a
 bond of marriage.

### #324 (Chapter 28)

 You amongst you who belong to those who carry out bond-bindings, your marriage-bindings and the celebra-
 tions connected with them are not rightful, but only matchmaking-orgies without any responsibility and con -
 scientiousness, without dignity and esteem with regard to a righteous connectedness.

### #325 (Chapter 28)

 But there are also those amongst you human beings of Earth who, in your seriously created nature, shudder in disgust at these unambiguous machinations, which is why you would like to turn away from them, but you
are rarely successful in doing that, because you are oppressed in your free will through the coercion of the society, the friends and all those involved.

### #326 (Chapter 28)

 And you young and elderly human beings who do not allow disgust to arise in your thoughts, feelings as well
 as in your dignity and in your feeling of honour when you are confronted with such celebrations, customs and
 traditions and therefore, out of your own responsibility, conscientiousness and righteousness as well as virtu-
 ousness, opt not to stay away from such doing, activity, organising and contributing, you put yourselves on the
 same level with those for whom the act of entering into the bond is only a matchmaking orgy, and as a result
 you can no longer be taken into consideration when it comes to evaluating what is right and righteous.

### #327 (Chapter 28)

 You who are in this wise fallible and hostile of the truthly life-conduct in accordance with the creational laws
 and recommendations, everything has developed in you in such a wise that you live as if in a poisoned delirious
 state through which you cheat yourselves about the fact what life and death really are; and the reason for this
 is that you do not want to be confronted with it through your thoughts and feelings, whereas the creeps and
 shyness play just as an important role as cowardice and the fact that already as children you had – because of
 the irresponsibility of your parents – not been instructed and taught with the thematic of the dying, the death
 as well as the procreation, the birth and the life, just as this irresponsible omission of the clarification already
 goes back to their parents and grandparents and the ancestors, to far into the past.

### #328 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth, you have built up your life upon unconsidered foundations, so all your customs,
 vices, Ausartungen and traditions have long become fixed and permanent terriblenesses from which you can
 only break away with great difficulties and as a rule only through evil disadvantage that strikes you.

### #329 (Chapter 28)

 And in the confusion and in the chaos of your terriblenesses, you can no longer understand that you cheat
 yourselves about your dying and death by crampfully trying not to think about it.

### #330 (Chapter 28)

 And if you recognise yourselves as those amongst human beings of Earth who were not procreated willingly
 and not consciously but haphazardly, then your pushing away of all serious thoughts and feelings with regard
 to your dying and death stands in a very close connection with the unconcernedness and moral low-state
 which was given at your procreation; and resulting out of this in many cases is that you as haphazard and
 undetermined procreation-fruit go like a shadow through your earthly life, as unright of a careless and undig -
 nified deed, because you were not procreated on the basis of a conscious and deliberate decision.

### #331 (Chapter 28)

 And if you do not recognise this truth and therefore can find neither the right way nor rest in your life, then
 you will in the end artificially and crampfully cling to a self-deception by seeing yourselves as a wanted fruit of
 a procreation, and therewith refusing the responsibility for your existence and hence are of the wrong opinion
 that your responsibility for your life lies with those who procreated you; but that is not the case at all, because
 once you are in this life, even if you did not contribute to the procreation, you nevertheless have to take the
 full responsibility for your life, for your thoughts and feelings as well as for all your activity and for your actions
 and deeds; but that means, even if your parents do not teach you this, that you yourselves are responsible for
 what you do with regard to your life, how you form and lead it, whereupon and how you direct your thoughts
 and feelings and what your attitude is towards the procreation, birth and the life as well as the dying, death
 and the rebirth of the spirit-form and the birth of each new personality.

### #332 (Chapter 28)

 And do not let your thoughts and feelings roam to this, that with the death everything is totally and defini-
 tively over, because with that you only evince that you keep your consciousness in inferiority and that you
 cowardly duck your responsibility towards the life and the death, whilst you also assume that you are not much
 better or worse than your fellow human beings.

### #333 (Chapter 28)

 If you nourish your thoughts and feelings in this wise, then you live in suspicious imaginations which, however,
 do not change a speck of dust of the weight of the fact that sooner or later you will be caught up to by the
 dying and the death, and that this can happen each day, each hour and each minute; and consider, when you
 are born and live into the life, the dying and the death are already coming closer and closer, and you do not
 know when your time of the life according to your right-based life-conduct will be expired in accordance with
 the effects of the creational principles.

### #334 (Chapter 28)

 Bethink yourselves of the true life and the truth of the creational laws and recommendations, so that you are
 not chickenhearted ones, and so you do not try to deny away in rigidity all responsibility for your own life and
 also the continued life after the dying as well as the rebirth of the spirit-form and the new birth of the new
 personality, through which in you, when your dying comes closer, great and angstful questions begin which
 prove that all of a sudden you become confused in what you erroneously believed in all your life.

### #335 (Chapter 28)

 But if you only come to intellect and rationality while you are dying, then you have missed the actual life and
 in cowardice missed the bearing of the life-responsibility, because you do not derive any benefit for your passed
 life anymore, if, shortly before the major step out of the earthly life into the death-life, you suddenly recognise
 the fact of the continued life of your spirit-form as well as its rebirth in a new life together with the birth of a
 new personality in a new consciousness-block.
 
### #336 (Chapter 28)

 Neither anxiety, fear, cowardice nor defiance allow a redemption or reduction of the interaction of all thoughts,
 feelings as well as all activity and all actions and deeds, because an insight and the recognition cannot be gained
 through a switching off and reducing of the interactions, but solely and exclusively through the searching and
 finding of the effective truth which you must fathom in yourselves, and indeed by finding the way of the truth
 in you which is both the truth and the culmination-point in one.

### #337 (Chapter 28)

 And you are many amongst you whose intellect-based discernment – so often used by you in your life – plays,
 out of fear, a vicious game on you in the last hours while you are dying, namely in that you suddenly, in accus-
 tomed precaution, want to become quickly intellectually and rationally diligent when you realise that the
 release from your coarse-substantial body is continuously reaching a higher degree; but truly, that will not bring
 you any gain, because you cannot, in the short time of the dying, catch up on and finish off that which you
 have neglected throughout your life, so what you will die with as harvest is what you have sown during your
 life through your thoughts and feelings, your activity and through your actions and deeds.

### #338 (Chapter 28)

 So if you do come to your senses during the dying, then you will not change the least therewith nor bring
 about any change and betterment, because it is not possible for you in the process of dying to finish off every-
 thing that you have neglected in the course of your entire life through the process of the perception, cognition,
 cognisance, knowledge, experience, living of the experience, and wisdom.

### #339 (Chapter 28)

 It is sad for you who tumble away in your earthly existence in reckless self-deception as if in a delirious state,
 and as a result you live in anxiety and fear and cause yourselves a bad destiny.

### #340 (Chapter 28)

 Lucky are however you others who do not waste your earthly existence, even though perhaps you only come
 out of your anxiety and fear and out of your determinations with regard to bad strokes of fate late in life and
 only slowly find the way to the truth and the consciousness-based evolution.

### #341 (Chapter 28)

 Your serious searching for the truth is a staff and a support for you, so that you can therewith make the con-
 scious step in your evolution and towards the finding of the truth without anxiousness, trembling and fear, and
 without stumbling.

### #342 (Chapter 28)

 The time of the serious searching for the truth and the thought-feeling-based careful study of the life and
 death as well as of the procreation, the birth and the rebirth of the spirit-form and the birth of the new per-
 sonality, all this you determine yourselves; but if you go this way in free volition, then this is an absolute progress
 for you which will bring you good things, make you happy and make all heavy things surprisingly easy for you,
 because your good volition will be so much more powerful than you have ever had as a presentiment; and if
 you go the way of the truth with regard to your thought-feeling-based careful study of the life and death, and
 of the procreation, the dying, the rebirth of the spirit-form and the birth of the new consciousness with the
 new personality, then the purely material will disappear as the most important aspect in your existence and grants
 an equalisedness between the spiritual, consciousness-based and material.

### #343 (Chapter 28)

 If you strive for the effective truth and for your consciousness-evolution, you may often ask yourselves with
 regard to the pure earthly matters, whether you shall free yourselves from your material goods or whether you
 shall simply pay no more attention to them, but truly that would be foolish, because you are material life forms
 and therefore you also need the material goods.

### #344 (Chapter 28)

 You shall only not cling onto your earthly goods and not let yourselves be oppressed through them, because
 you cannot tread the way of the fathoming of the truth through servitude; so in the searching for the truth it
 is not recommended to you to give or throw away your earthly goods so that you shall live in poverty.

### #345 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you shall happily and freely appreciate and rejoice whatever material goods are accessible to you, provided
 that you acquire them honestly and that you do not let yourselves be enslaved through them, so that you do
 not omit striving for the real truth of all truth because of such a servitude, so despite your material richness
 and all possessions of your earthly goods you live in a fulfilling wise in the creational laws and recommenda-
 tions.

### #346 (Chapter 28)

 That you shall not cling onto material goods only means that you shall not let yourselves get carried away to
 assume that the grabbing together of material possessions is the highest and most important purpose of your
 earthly existence, so therefore you do not predominantly direct your thoughts and feelings upon them and do
 not fall into possession-greed.

### #347 (Chapter 28)

 But if you do fall prey to the possession-greed with regard to material values of any kind, then this attitude will
 keep you away from the higher culmination-point of the truth-search and from the fathoming and following
 of the creational laws and recommendations, wherethrough you will go about in great erroneous assumption
 with regard to the fulfilling of the life-sense.

### #348 (Chapter 28)

 If you fall prey to the material, the earthly goods and possessions, then you will no longer find the time to
 search for and find the truth of all truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations, just as is the case
 if you have fallen prey to a religious, ideological or philosophical belief and therewith a devotion to a god, tin
 god or idolised human being.

### #349 (Chapter 28)

 Falling prey to material possessions and clinging thereon means being attached with all fibres of your life as well as your thoughts, feelings, wishes and your hopes and desires only to the sole purpose of the acquisition
and possession thereof, and to worry about them; and this irrespective of whether this attachment is for the sake of the possession and the goods themselves or for the sake of the avariciousness and the pleasure which is made possible through the amassing of money and goods; but no matter what causes and purposes lead to the greed with regard to goods and riches, in the end, the result remains always the same.

### #350 (Chapter 28)

 With the greed for possession and riches, for money, goods and chattels you bind and cling yourselves onto
 the purely material, wherethrough you lose the sight for what is ahead and above, for the effective truth and
 therewith for everything creational and for the Creation-given laws and recommendations.

### #351 (Chapter 28)

 Your wrong understanding however, that material possession and earthly goods do not belong to the assidu-
 ousness for the truth of all truth and not to the higher-striving of the consciousness-evolution, has, through
 the belief in a god, tin god or idolised human being, created the senseless attitude in the majority of you Earth-
 humans that all endeavours, if they are taken seriously, with regard to the search for the effective truth must
 have nothing to do with material possession and earthly goods; but you are not conscious that you equate the
 effective truth with your wrong belief in a god, tin god or idolised human being, nor are you conscious of the
 fact that you as entire Earth-humankind have brought upon yourselves great disadvantage in your conscious-
 ness-development, as also with regard to your humaneness, your behaviour concerning the love for the next
 one, the love in general as well as the being fair, the conscientiousness, fairness and righteousness and the
 bearing of the responsibility in all things.

### #352 (Chapter 28)

 In your wrong religious, ideological or philosophical belief you devaluate your consciousness-based, therefore
 the highest gifts that can be given to you in your life; through your belief in an invented god, tin god or idol-
 ised human being you have indeed won a strange attitude with regard to your consciousness-based endeav-
 ours, because you confound these with religious and sectarian submissiveness and beggary, in which case you
 are doggishly dependent on sacrifices and donations which you offer to your god, tin god or a human being
 raised to a divinity hoping to get help and enlightenment in exchange; therefore you have the same attitude
 as beggars who in a beseeching-submissive wise debase themselves in front of you in order to get a beggar’s
 penny, and as a result they are as unable to create respect for themselves as are you, you who act just like
 them, only towards your god, tin god or idolised human being; the respect which you ought to give yourselves
 and which would also be due to you, if you perceived and recognised yourselves as lord and master of your-
 selves and behaved accordingly, that respect you give, in doggish humility, to your fabulated god or tin god or
 else to a human being that you have raised up as a divinity.

### #353 (Chapter 28)

 All your wrong endeavours bear from the beginning a seed of the destruction in them, which can grow more
 and more, to the point that you cannot put yourselves on your own feet, but instead remain dependent on
 your religious, ideological or philosophical belief, on your belief in a fabulated god, tin god or a human being
 that you idolise.

### #354 (Chapter 28)

 And precisely for the sake of the effective truth and your consciousness-evolution as well as the following of
 the creational laws and recommendations you must protect yourselves against any belief, and it must be clear
 to you that you are not allowed to disdain the earthly goods because they are essential for your existence, and
 therefore you shall not listen to the wrong and irrational speeches of those who go about in their religious,
 ideological or philosophical delusion and claim, contrary to all truth, that the consciousness-evolution could
 not be brought into agreement with material goods; but that you thereby, with regard to the consciousness-
 evolution, talk of an evolution of the spiritual, because you do not know the truth and do not know that as
 human beings you are, through your perceptions, cognitions, cognisance, the knowledge, the experience and
 the living of it as well as the thereout resulting essence, the wisdom, integrated through the creational laws
 directly into the evolution of your consciousness and only indirectly into the spiritual, that is uncomprehensible
 to you; therefore, you must first search for and find the truth of all truth, and indeed in the wise that you search
 for the way of the truth in yourselves, fathom it and follow it, because only in this wise will you find the real
 truth which is itself the way and the culmination-point.

### #355 (Chapter 28)

 In your coarse-substantial world, the material must serve you as a shield so that you can avert like with like,
 that is, you avert the material with the material in the wise that you do not let yourselves be deluded by the
 material, so that your material possessions, your riches, goods and chattels do not become excessive and the
 burden to you of this, that you become dominated by them and you thus lose the way of the truth in you
 through which you find the true love, freedom, harmony and peace in you.

### #356 (Chapter 28)

 Consider that you shall also not let yourselves be pushed into an unhealthy state of the truth-refusal and truth- denial through your materialistic fellow human beings, if they present you their material possessions and riches
and want to bribe you therewith; be conscious that if you are ones who are striving upwards in terms of the evo-
lution of your consciousness and searching for the truth, then your scrupleless opponents will bring forward their
strongest weapon in order to delude you, namely their material riches and possessions as well as their goods and
chattels; and if you are ones who are striving upwards with regard to the effective truth of all truth, then it would
be evil carelessness, if you let yourselves be deluded by your opponents who are hostile-minded towards the
truth through their material goods and values, because that could prove to be a major disadvantage for you.

### #357 (Chapter 28)

 But you truthful searchers for the real truth and for the effects of the creational laws and recommendations,
 do not disdain the earthly goods, if you acquire them, use them in right measure and do not let yourselves be
 deluded in avarice through them, so that you do not become their slaves, are always free and make good use
 of them so that you are able to fathom the truth and follow it and thus give enough consideration to the
 Creation-given laws and recommendations.

### #358 (Chapter 28)

 But do not be beggars with regard to material richness and possession either, because as human beings you
 shall not wear a beggar’s clothes and debase yourselves, but neither shall you set a crown of possession and
 richness upon your head in order to be ostentatious with them and to raise above others and to let them believe
 in miracles, if you give them a little bit of your riches, out of whatever reasons.

### #359 (Chapter 28)

 However, there are no miracles in the conventional sense, because the term miracle only clarifies something that you do not understand, namely a process about which you fall into ununderstanding, i.e. into astonishment.

### #360 (Chapter 28)

 For you, a miracle is something that you do not consider possible and also do not understand that it can become
 reality nevertheless; but you merely consider it impossible, because by occurring and becoming reality it proves
 that that which is ununderstandable and astonishing to you nevertheless is and becomes reality.

### #361 (Chapter 28)

 In accordance with your religious belief-imagination, a miracle is something which truthly does not exist, namely
 that something is, as a happening, brought to the manifestation and reality by a god, tin god or human being
 raised to a divinity, something which contradicts all laws of nature and is related back by you to supernatural,
 godly, tin godly human beings or those raised to the status of a divinity.

### #362 (Chapter 28)

 You think a miracle is something that happens outside of the laws of nature and thus something which stands
 against all laws of nature and wherein you illusively see something which is supposed to be of godly or tin
 godly origin or originated by an idolised human being; the reason for this is that for you, because of your reli-
 gious and sectarian belief, a miracle can only be something which shall only be possible for a god, tin god or
 idolised human being who therethrough is apparently showing you a special grace and who for the carrying
 out of the miracle is making use of his or her omnipotence – thus you believe in your religious and sectarian
 godliness, through which you give the effective truth no chance to get through in you.

### #363 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth are poor in your intellect and in your rationality, because you erroneously imagine
 by the all-mightiness – which is a characteristic only of the Creation as Universal Consciousness itself but not
 of any fabulated god, tin god or idolised human being – the possibility of arbitrariness and hence a miracle as
 an act of arbitrariness, because you do not consider how much you therewith minimise the creational laws and
 recommendations and their effects, because if they acted in a wise of the arbitrariness, then they would no
 longer be in accordance with the Creation-given laws and recommendations.

### #364 (Chapter 28)

 Primarily, there is an absolute, relative full-development in the creational activity which shows no errors and no
 gaps and is therewith integrated into strictest logic, i.e. an absolute logicalness down into the last iota, although
 the logic can, in its truthly form, be continuously further developed and never stands still.

### #365 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore, according to the relatively absolutely fully-developed logic, a so-called miracle in logicalness must
 have an outcoming effect as a distinct happening, and indeed, depending on the cause and the thereout
 resulting developmental process, right up to the effect which is seen as a miracle, but in logicalness is merely
 the ultimate effect out of the cause.

### #366 (Chapter 28)

 If you look at what you call miracles, then you realise that, according to your understanding, a miracle takes a
 longer time to happen, whereas the development-process however happens in the usual time frame, namely
 with incredible speed, just as is the case with the course and speed of the thoughts and feelings.

### #367 (Chapter 28)

 Miracles come about through you yourselves, be it through an energy and its power that you yourselves have
 created in you, or by means of another kind and wise; and because it occurs through an unusually quick hap-
 pening which manifests itself through your hopes and wishes or begging and beseeching, so you are astonished,
 find it wonderful and simply call it a miracle.

### #368 (Chapter 28)

 And if you create a miracle, then you create it through your own energy and power which you in any kind and
 wise concentratedly bring to use, and thereby it is also possible that the occurring miracle goes beyond your
 present consciousness-evolution, and the reason for this is that you have unconsciously created and mobilised
 energies and powers in you, over which you have no control in your normal consciousness-state.

### #369 (Chapter 28)

 But the entire process never takes place outside the existing laws of nature nor does it in any wise set itself
 against them; if something did happen outside the laws of nature or set itself against them – which is absolutely
 impossible – then everything creational would in that moment lose itself in itself and reduce itself to absurdity,
 because the whole would become an act of the arbitrariness; therefore, the case is exactly the opposite of what
 you believers in fabulated gods and tin gods as well as human beings raised to the status of divinities wrongly
 assume.

### #370 (Chapter 28)

 Know that everything that is devoid of the strict logic, i.e. the logicalness cannot be brought in connection
 with the activity of the Creation Universal Consciousness nor with the laws and recommendations of the
 Creation as well as with their effects.
 
### #371 (Chapter 28)

 And also know that every miracle is an absolutely normal and natural process, which, however, comes about
 in high speed and solely through concentrated energy and power; miracles can sometimes also take longer
 before they occur, because fundamentally, their kind is always of importance; but miracles correspond in each
 case always to a natural developmental process of cause and effect, because never ever can something unna-
 tural happen, as this is in each case absolutely impossible; the laws of nature cannot be bent or falsified, because
 they are based in the Creation-given laws and recommendations which are at all times unchangeable through
 the Creation Universal Consciousness, contrary to your human sense and human view.

### #372 (Chapter 28)

 To your human sense and your human view are also connected your earthly jurisdictions, but you must not
 expect that these are equivalent with the strength of the character and of all virtues of the Creation Universal
 Consciousness nor with the Creation-given laws and recommendations to which your earthly courts and their
 laws do not even get close; exactly the opposite is the case, because between your understanding of the fair-
 ness and of the creational fairness (i.e. the Creation's strength of the character and of all virtues) there is gener-
 ally in the true sense of the word a scandalous and shaking difference.

### #373 (Chapter 28)

 This bottomless difference can be explained by your intellect that is restricted by space and time and your poor
 rationality, in whose narrowness you are not able to perceive and recognise the actual unright in order to sepa-
 rate it from the true right; but the actual right you cannot recognise because it is for you, on account of your
 restricted and atrophied perception-capability, only seldom recognisable and comprehensible in its outer form
 and truliness; fundamentally, according to your sense, the right lies only in your inner, i.e. in you yourselves,
 because you bend it in accordance with your requirements to suit a present situation; this in addition to the
 fact that you decide everything on the basis of the legal norms of your society and that you are in bondage to
 the rigid law-paragraphs and the school-knowledge.

### #374 (Chapter 28)

 What is sad about your behaviour of the personal and social fairness and the thereout resulting laws as well
 as your jurisdictions and many decisions and punishments resulting thereout, is that they directly counteract
 the creational laws.

### #375 (Chapter 28)

 And if these counter-actions are spoken of, then not those are meant, which happened in the sad times of the
 Middle Ages in the form of tormentful tortures and so-called burnings of the witches through your delusional
 belief, the Inquisition and your jurisdictions as well as the delusion of your imperious religious fanatics and
 various other crimes; nor shall there be talk of the other methods of torturing, murdering and waring, the
 blame for which goes to practically all religions which, in the name of their fabulated god, tin god or a human
 being raised to the status of a divinity, committed all these tremendous crimes, and this was done as supposed
 well-pleasing favour for their god, tin god or idolised human being who were then made responsible for these
 actions.

### #376 (Chapter 28)

 Altogether, your past has brought tremendous atrocities and misuse in this respect, which must not be forgot-
 ten, nor must they be high-stylised in any kind and wise, such as through remembrance-festivities and such
 nonsense which only lead to the fact that those incapable of using their intellect and rationality take up the
 old and act in the same wise as their ancestors.

### #377 (Chapter 28)

 What has to be done is that the atrocities and misuse be warningly assessed in a rational wise, that particularly those committing the crimes at that time did so in the delusion of their religious, ideological or philosophical
belief and erroneously assumed that they were in the right on account of the irrational teachings of a religious,
philosophical, ideological or political kind that had an effect on them, so they acted in their delusional belief.

### #378 (Chapter 28)

 Many things have changed amongst you human beings of Earth since then, but you still zealously believe in
 your religions, ideologies, politics and philosophies and hence in your gods, tin gods and idolised human
 beings; but truly, you still do many things wrong in your administration of justice, and therefore your farther
 descendants will look back on you and your legislations with shudder and horror, just as you look back on the
 Middle Ages and the old times before when the insanity of the religious horror ruled and human sacrifices were
 still offered in the belief that this had thrilled the gods and tin gods.

### #379 (Chapter 28)

 How you look back on these old times today, which according to your present cognitions and terms were bearing
 in them blatant misery and boundless unright as well as unbelievable unhumaneness, is how your descendants
 will one day look back on the past, if they think about your time, your actions which are far from the creational
 laws, your unintellect and your irrationality, your contempt for humankind, the destruction of the nature, the
 eradication of many plants, fishes, birds, animals and other creatures and the destruction of the climate.

### #380 (Chapter 28)

 Since those old times, you have made great progress only in the outer forms, in the technology, in the medicine
 and in your material achievements, whereas in your consciousness-development you continue to lag behind
 immensely, because truthly, the deeply incisive all-mightiness of your personal irresponsible turning-away from
 the creational laws and recommendations in your existence is still the same.

### #381 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, since time immemorial you have neither changed as human beings yourselves nor have you brought about changes in your actions and activity, nor in the nurturing of your thoughts and feelings, because you still
 believe in your gods, tin god and idolised human beings and still are attached to your wrong religions, ideolo-
 gies and philosophies; and as yet you have created real love and freedom, harmony and true peace neither in
 yourselves nor amongst you all of the whole humankind, and instead you still practise hatred against each
 other, be it because of the belief, the money, the partner or the race, and so you continue to go through life
 in jealousy, resentment and avarice and as ever you conduct strife and wage wars, commit torture, murder and
 manslaughter and indulge in all vices, pathological cravings and crimes.

### #382 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you have not changed and the few who did you insult and persecute them with your lies and slander,
 because as your inner life is still the same with regard to your individuality, so the interactions are still the same
 as well, and consequently the creational in the core of your inner nature cannot come to fruition.

### #383 (Chapter 28)

 If you human beings of Earth as entire earthly humanity were all of a sudden seeing and knowing, then one
 single tremendous scream of the horror and despair would resound through the world, and a tremendous
 dread would lay over all your peoples; and if that happened, then there would not be one amongst you who
 could raise his or her hand against his or her next one in reproach, because the cognition would consciously
 come to each one amongst you in one wise or another that the same guilt burdens him or her that also the
 other has to bear.

### #384 (Chapter 28)

 And the cognition that each one in some wise carries the same guilt would lead to the certainty that no one
 amongst you human beings of Earth has the right to come up against your next one or other fellow human
 being with reproach, thoughts of revenge and retaliation or with hatred, because every single one of you – no
 matter how good and blameless you think you are – up until now erringly assesses only according to outer
 appearances, and in so doing you ignore the true life as well as the creational laws and recommendations
 which you should observe and follow.

### #385 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, there are many amongst you who would end up in despair in yourselves at the first cognition, if it came
 into you without preparation, and you many others amongst you who have during the course of your life never
 thought about these important things, you would be befallen by excessive bitterness, because you have
 neglected the whole during your life.

### #386 (Chapter 28)

 Everything should be an impulse for you to the calm consideration, in order to further the development of your
 own true discernment, which rejects any dependence on strange and wrong views and only accepts what you
 create yourselves in logic, intellect and rationality through your own thoughts and feelings as well as through
 your speaking, acting and activity and what you can logically follow in you as effective truth.

### #387 (Chapter 28)

 You must never forget that you alone have to take responsibility for all and everything, irrespective of whatever
 thoughts and feelings you create in you and what you bring forth through your actions, deeds and through your
 activity; and this full responsibility you also carry if everything which you bring into effect in any kind and wise
 was the result of you taking it over from others in an unquestioning wise.

### #388 (Chapter 28)

 But good for you, you human beings of Earth, if in your doing, actions and activity as well as in your thoughts
 and feelings you reach a height that allows you to meet every assessment in an examining wise in order to act
 according to your own choosing in any wise you like.

### #389 (Chapter 28)

 And if you are so far that you can act and be active in full responsibility of your own choosing in any kind and
 wise, then you do not make yourselves guilty of all the unright and unrightful, as many amongst you do, because
 there is only an acting out of thoughtlessness, calumny, prejudice and a lust for sensation etc., and this leads
 into realms in which only affliction, hardship, and pain as well as sorrow, anxiety and fear rule, which do not
 have to be experienced on your own body and in your own consciousness in an actual-acute wise.

### #390 (Chapter 28)

 However, if you act against the truth and all the forms of the appearance-possibilities of the life, then you let
 yourselves be kept from many really good things of the existence and hence neglect to do a lot for yourselves
 and your fellow human beings, because you irresponsibly gamble with everything valueful which your life has
 to offer you.

### #391 (Chapter 28)

 Already in the times of old, you human beings of Earth gambled with all your well-being and spread endless hatred, jealousy, war, crime, destruction and ruin, namely with regard to your entire humankind in general and
against your true prophets in particular; you have maltreated, tortured and murdered millions of your own kind
and still do the same today, but the real reasons for all this are known only to the few screaming and irrespon-
sible criminals who you tolerate as authorities and rulers and who, through the death penalty and through
wars and other terror bring terribleness upon you and the world; but thereto also belong those out of your
own rows who as instigators of a people call, in manifold religious, sectarian, ideological, philosophical and
political form, for murder, manslaughter, terror and destruction, and so it is also those amongst you who ter-
rorise their families and at any time out of insignificant reasons take the first opportunity to have a quarrel with
the next ones and with neighbours and let themselves be driven by jealousy, hatred, revenge and retribution.

### #392 (Chapter 28)

 And you as mass of humankind of Earth, you let yourselves be seduced by the irresponsible shouters, terrorists, instigators of a people, murderous rulers and criminals of all kinds and be put into blind fanaticism, in which
you howl with the wolves and sow death and ruin amongst your fellow human beings and amongst entire
peoples, and indeed without thinking even in a speck of dust of a weight about what it is you are actually doing, and this is why you also cannot differentiate between right and unright.

### #393 (Chapter 28)

 In your wrong doing you also insult and slander your true prophets, the proclaimers of the teaching of the
 truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, the ‹Goblet of the
 Truth›, without ever actually coming together with the proclaimers, and hence you do not know them; truly,
 you who insult and slander the true proclaimers and their teaching, you are lost ones with regard to the truth
 and the life.

### #394 (Chapter 28)

 No less lost with regard to the truth and the life are also you amongst you human beings of Earth who, due
 to wrong views of your fellow human beings, turn away from the real truth and do not want to hear the words
 of the teaching of the truth and who do not make the effort of an factual proof, through which you finally
 could recognise the true and great value of the teaching of the truth.

### #395 (Chapter 28)

 Through all your doing, activity, behaviour and actions which are erroneous and hostile to the life and the evo-
 lution of your consciousness you have time and again called forth immense tragedies and brought death, misery,
 hardship, destruction and ruin over your humankind.

### #396 (Chapter 28)

 And you have persecuted, cursed and slandered those who have brought you the real truth, through which
 you could have led your life rightfully, namely your true prophets who since time immemorial have come to
 you and brought you the teaching through which you could have learned about the creational laws and recom-
 mendations in order to follow them and to form your existence for your own pleasure.

### #397 (Chapter 28)

 Your doing, activity and actions have, since time immemorial, been so grotesque that with dazzling clarity they
 show your narrowness of intellect and rationality which has not changed to the better since, but still continues
 to exist and still puts you as entire terrestrial humankind into a state of anxiety and horror.

### #398 (Chapter 28)

 Up until today you have not progressed any further innerly in the realm of the inner nature built up by you
 yourselves as individuality as well as in your consciousness-evolution with regard to the effective truth of all
 truth, the knowledge and the wisdom, because truly you have only created an outer change through your dis-
 coveries and inventions, but with regard to the evolution of your consciousness you lag behind and continue
 to indulge in the evil and malicious temptations of your religions, your sectarianism, your politics, ideologies
 and philosophies through which you are kept away from the effective truth and you do not recognise the cre-
 ational laws and recommendations, in fact you do not even search for them.

### #399 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you only have outer successes to mention, for example with regard to your technology, medicine and
 other achievements, but this outer state of progress is no more than a conceit through which you try to cover
 up your own narrowness of intellect and rationality, but this conceit in itself is already a pronounced character-
 istic of the narrowness.

### #400 (Chapter 28)

 And for almost four thousand years, in which your great religions, sects, ideologies and philosophies and your
 catastrophic forms of politics have arisen, the basis of your Ausartungen of all kinds and the turning away from
 the real truth of all truth and hence from the Creation Universal Consciousness and its laws and recommen-
 dations has become increasingly dreadful.

### #401 (Chapter 28)

 And all your turning away from the Creation, its laws and recommendations and hence also from the effective
 truth has had such a decisive and devastating effect on your views that you have created a cluelessness with
 regard to the real truth and the effective reality, become entangled in it and therewith suggestively and force-
 fully brought about your own disaster.

### #402 (Chapter 28)

 Through wrong views which you often believed to be good, you have incurred evil effects in terms of inter-
 actions, which have brought you tremendous harm, because you acted against the creational laws and recom-
 mendations, which has, however, up to the present day not become clear to you.

### #403 (Chapter 28)

 The number of those of you acting and behaving in this wise has been huge since time immemorial, and in
 your presumptuousness and vanity as well as wrong pride you have brought over your world tormentful horror,
 terribleness, destruction, death and ruin, and you do not know that the true life and the real truth and reality
 of all creational existence is completely different from what you think and imagine.

### #404 (Chapter 28)

 So you must act before it is too late and before you bring even more guilt upon yourselves, for which you will
 have to atone in processes lasting for decades, centuries, even millennia, if through your wrong doing, actions
 and activity, you create more and more hatred, jealously, strife, terror, war, unfreedom, disharmony, unpeace
 and vices as well as pathological cravings, and therefore you will have to struggle to even be able to still live
 on your world which, through your constantly growing overpopulation and its effects, you destroy to such an
 extent that in the end your earth can no longer recover from it.

### #405 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, your way to the cognition is long and heavy, but if you have achieved the cognition, then the way you
 must go to create in yourselves the developmental change to the good, better and best is even much longer
 and heavier.

### #406 (Chapter 28)

 The way is long and heavy, and if you neglect the favourable opportunity and in your unknowledge wantedly or unwantedly continue to load great guilt upon yourselves, then a bad end cannot be avoided; and during
your doing, activity and actions, always consider that if you do them in the unright, an excuse will have no weight, because the life itself does not accept any excuse for whatever unrightful and wrong things you do, because the life only knows the law of the causality, the cause and effect, as it is pre-given through the cre- ational laws and recommendations.

### #407 (Chapter 28)

 Those of you human beings of Earth who feel the urge, in the course of the interactions cause and effect, to
 recognise and to understand the effects given through the creational laws and recommendations, must see
 them in the difference to the earthly views and make the effort to take an example out of your own existence
 for comparison and to examine where right an unright really are given.

### #408 (Chapter 28)

 And if this comprehensive examination is made and passed, then you will be able to unfold your own intellect-
 and rationality-capability more vividly and strongly in order to ultimately cast off everything with regard to
 learned prejudices of inadequate views and attitudes.

### #409 (Chapter 28)

 If this happens, then an understanding of fairness will therethrough be created in you which can rely on itself
 and through which you, in your recognising of all interactions, recognise and accept the creational laws and
 recommendations which then can widen and be active in you.

### #410 (Chapter 28)

 If you observe and consider yourselves with regard to the interactions, then you recognise that cause and effect
 also arise in you in a wise that corresponds to your attitude and that guides you when you refer it to the past
 or future.

### #411 (Chapter 28)

 You amongst you human beings of Earth who live in the past with your attitude, you comprehend something only then, when it has already happened; and resulting out of this is that you can neither really enjoy nor get
angry about what happened, nor can you logically follow and understand the whole severity of the whole case.

### #412 (Chapter 28)

 Only afterwards, after a longer time, when everything is already over, do you begin to make thoughts and feel- ings about it and to talk about it, and to either worry about the past happening or to enthuse over it.

### #413 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore, you only talk of what lies in the past, feel good therein or regret it, but in doing so you completely
 overlook the new and present things that again come about; because only when everything has already be-
 come old and moved into the past do you begin to have thoughts and feelings about the past happening and
 to value it.

### #414 (Chapter 28)

 And you amongst you human beings of Earth who with your attitude live in the near or far future, you only
 ever hope and wish for things that the future shall bring you, but in doing so you forget that the present of
 your everyday life has a lot to offer you; at the same time you also forget to make efforts in such a wise that
 you could let your wishes for the near and far future actually become reality.

### #415 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, many of you belong to the majority of your humankind who fritter away your life and lead no real and
 truthful life on Earth, nor do those amongst you who believe to live in the present but have a completely wrong
 understanding of it.

### #416 (Chapter 28)

 And those of you who wrongly understand the present, you spur yourselves every moment to recklessly en-
 courage yourselves to the life and to live it to the fullest and enjoy it in an ausgeartet wise; and truly, there are
 many of you of this kind who thus tumble through your life in an affirming, jubilant and senseless wise.

### #417 (Chapter 28)

 It is right that you live your life in every minute and second to the fullest in an absolute wise, but not only in
 the outer and material realm but also in your inner, in accordance with the true creational core of your inner
 nature which you have covered over with the rubbish, the chaff of your self-created individuality.

### #418 (Chapter 28)

 Each second, minute and hour of the present must become a real and truthful experiencing in your life, and
 indeed in the affliction as well as in the joy, in the fortune and in the unfortune.

### #419 (Chapter 28)

 With all your senses, thoughts and feelings you must be open and alert to that which you know as the present;
 although the present is only short and only covers a short moment, you also have the present as your everyday
 life in which you live, are active and act.

### #420 (Chapter 28)

 Only if you go towards the present of the moment and of the everyday life with openness and alertness, do
 you have an advantage from your earthly existence, an advantage that you create for yourselves.

### #421 (Chapter 28)

 Neither in the thoughts and feelings which are related to the past nor in your dreams of the future can you
 find a real and truthful living-experience, because this is solely limited to the immediate present; and only the
 experiencing of the immediate present through living it is so full of energy and strong that it forms the con -
 sciousness which integrates the advantage of the living-experience into the actual life and furthers the con-
 sciousness-based evolution.

### #422 (Chapter 28)

 If you do not co-live the present, then you also cannot ripen in yourselves, because the ripening depends on
 your practical experience and the living of the same, which is preceded by the perception, recognition and cog-
 nisance as well as the knowledge, out of which altogether the essence, the wisdom, results.

### #423 (Chapter 28)

 If during your life you do not experience the present through living it in your inner nature yourselves, then you
 are empty in yourselves and neglect the time, because you are not awake and because you do not make your
 life your own.

### #424 (Chapter 28)

 Your currently actual life on Earth is only one of many steps in the development that you go through in the
 always returning existence of your spirit-form and in the course of your always new personalities, and truly you
 cannot skip these steps, but you must climb one after the other.
 
### #425 (Chapter 28)

 And if you do not stand strong and firm on the current step of your development in the life, then you will have great strain to climb up to the next step, because you will need the preceding step as a firm foundation.

### #426 (Chapter 28)

 These steps correspond to your consciousness-based development-state, and according to how this state is
 given, it will be possible for you to develop yourselves further and to climb up the next step.

### #427 (Chapter 28)

 If you make a conscious effort to climb up the steps of your upward-striving development during your existence
 one by one, then it will become clear to you that you can only reach the next step, if you have correctly fulfilled
 the development on the preceding step.

### #428 (Chapter 28)

 Only through the full, absolute fulfilment of a development-step is it possible to climb up to the next higher
 one; but if you do not fulfil it through the perception, the cognition, the cognisance, the knowledge, the prac-
 tical experience and its living, the taking-in, comprehending and experiencing it through living it in the present,
 then you cannot get the essence of the whole, i.e. the wisdom, which builds the state of the higher develop-
 ment reached.

### #429 (Chapter 28)

 If you do not fulfil this developmental process through the real experiencing of the present through living it,
 namely in the realm of the material as well as in your inner and in the fine-fluidal, then nothing can contribute
 to the ripeness in you, so you are, from your present development-step, not able to recognise and step on the
 next one; only with the equipment of the true experiencing of the present through living it in all domains of
 your existence, in your inner, in the fine-fluidal and material, do you create the energy and power to perceive
 your next development-step and also to climb up to it.

### #430 (Chapter 28)

 In this wise it goes on and on through your entire actual life and it went on like this in all your previous lives
 as always new personalities, and it will also be so in your new lives as new personalities, once you have left
 your present existence.

### #431 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you need only look after your high fulfilments of your consciousness-evolution and hence pay due atten-
 tion to your individual development-steps which, for the purpose of your evolution, you must build and use
 yourselves in order to reach your fulfilment.

### #432 (Chapter 28)

 The evolution-steps, which you must create for yourselves and use for your climb up, must not be worked out cursorily, otherwise they easily break down as you try to climb up to the next step; however, you can react to
the danger of the breaking down while climbing up to the next step, namely through the natural happening
of this, that each higher development-step can only be reached by fully developing the step of the present.

### #433 (Chapter 28)

 If you therefore do not want to stand still on one development-step for half of your life and do not want to
 keep falling back again and again, then you must make great efforts to always perceive the whole of the present
 in the material, in your inner and in the fine-fluidal, to comprehend everything rightly, to experience and live
 it and to build it up to the wisdom, so that you gain thereout evolutive, consciousness-based benefit.

### #434 (Chapter 28)

 And if you act accordingly, then you will also not lack in earthly gains, because you make use of the advan-
 tage that you expect nothing else from space and time and from your fellow human beings than what they
 can really give you; and that is the reason why you will never be disappointed and why you are able to live in
 love, peace, freedom and harmony with yourselves as well as with your fellow human beings and the whole
 environment.

### #435 (Chapter 28)

 But if you live not in the reality of the present, but instead with your thoughts and feelings in the past or in
 your dreams of the future, then your expectations will easily fall out of the frame of what is real and rational,
 because they reach beyond the reality of the present and hence create in you a disharmony from which you
 will then suffer, and indeed both in yourselves and in your nearer and wider surrounding area.

### #436 (Chapter 28)

 You shall certainly think of that which lies in the past, but you shall not make it to celebrations and to con-
 stant memories, rather you shall only use it to learn thereout and to make everything better.

### #437 (Chapter 28)

 Equally, you can also dream of the future, however you shall not wallow therein in unfulfillable wishes nor in detrimental fantasies and illusions, so that you find a true incentive, through your future-dreamings, to live
consciously in the present and to dedicate yourselves to the upward-swinging of your consciousness-evolution.

### #438 (Chapter 28)

 The upward-swinging, i.e. the climb up to your consciousness-evolution does not have any distinct rule, so no
 specific way can be directed in this respect; a directed way would be like a template in which there would be
 nothing living, and consequently nothing living could arise out of it that is absolutely necessary for the upward-
 swinging, because only that which is living can again create something living.

### #439 (Chapter 28)

 If you want to climb up to the consciousness-evolution, then you can only do that on your own individual way
 which is formed for you alone, and therefore a directed way would be the individual way of someone else and
 would only be an outer, weak crutch for you, on which you could not walk rightly and autonomously, because
 it serves neither for the perceiving, nor for the seeing and the recognising, but rather only for the handicapped
 movement.

### #440 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore you must search for your own way and see it clearly and precisely before you so that you do not go
 forward upon it blindly.
 
### #441 (Chapter 28)

 But if you take on a suggested way which you do not find yourselves, then you will go forward on it limpingly
 and blindly, because you will simply follow a new dogma which had been talked into you, instead of you giving
 the necessary guidelines to yourselves through which you tread your own way to truth, knowledge and wis-
 dom and therewith to the consciousness-evolution.

### #442 (Chapter 28)

 And consider, if you want to get into the realm of your consciousness and therethrough give enough consid-
 eration to its evolution, then you must naturally search for, find and go to the way thereto yourselves, because
 it cannot be shown to you by anyone and it also does not come to you on its own.

### #443 (Chapter 28)

 Your consciousness is in the lowness of your coarse substantialness the highest factor of your possible deve-
 lopment, therefore you must do everything in this coarse-substantialness in order to get the best possible
 height of your consciousness-evolution; therefore you must wander through the coarse-substantial in order to
 reach your fulfilment.

### #444 (Chapter 28)

 So that you do not go astray on your way to the consciousness-evolution, it is necessary that you precisely
 research and know the way you have to tread and to wander through; however you must not only know the
 way itself, but also let everything become conscious to you, what can come across you on the way, which
 dangers can threaten you and which help you can find.

### #445 (Chapter 28)

 And since the whole way lies only in you yourselves, in your own consciousness and in the thereout resulting thoughts and their feelings, you must find and recognise it alone, if you want to come to the fulfilment.

### #446 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, there is no human being who could describe to you your individual way that is necessary for your rise up
 to your consciousness-evolution, so there is nobody who could make your own way to the highest form of
 your development clearly visible and recognisable to you except you yourselves.

### #447 (Chapter 28)

 The way to that height, which lies in the realm of your consciousness as temple of your highest possible devel-
 opment, is the way to your well-being, to your true love, harmony and freedom as well as to the true peace
 in yourselves, and that alone is the reality.

### #448 (Chapter 28)

 Since time immemorial, the message of the true prophets has shown you, through the ‹Goblet of the Truth›,
 the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, the
 right way to the upward-swinging with regard to your consciousness-evolution, but the teaching was always
 wrongly interpreted by you through your human, overbearing wanting-to-be-clever; you have falsified the
 teaching beyond recognition and made out of it religions, ideologies and philosophies as well as a signpost
 which has led you to the belief in godheads, tin gods and idolised human beings, and through this you have
 misleadingly turned yourselves to the greatest erroneous assumption which you could have made since your
 existence and which has prevented you from treading the way of the effective truth consciously and willingly
 and from giving enough consideration to the creational laws and recommendations and the consciousness-
 evolution.

### #449 (Chapter 28)

 It is now finally time for you to consciously decide for the effective truth and for the height of the conscious- ness-evolution in which you can swing upwards and irrevocably find your way out of the lowness of your truth-
unknowledge, and indeed without possibility of you falling back again into your old habits at some later time.

### #450 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore, the message of the truth is brought to you once again, so that you turn your wrongly positioned
 signpost in the right direction and are earnest searchers, so that you find, recognise and follow the way of the
 truth in yourselves which is both the way of the truth itself and the fulfillment.

### #451 (Chapter 28)

 Good for you therefore, if you are open in your senses and you consciously direct your thoughts and feelings
 accordingly, because if you do this, then you will learn about the truth of all truth as well as the creational laws
 and recommendations which, for your consciousness, serve as rungs for the upward-swinging in order to con-
 sciously enter the realm of your consciousness-evolution.

### #452 (Chapter 28)

 In your consciousness and in your thereout resulting thoughts and their feelings alone you find everything you
 need to create your capabilities through which you can climb up into the heights of your consciousness-evo-
 lution.

### #453 (Chapter 28)

 It is first your true life, which you must live, that gives you the dynamic and the freedom for the development
 of the necessary capabilities which are necessary for the climbing up into the heights of the consciousness-evo-
 lution and through which you can free yourselves from the yoke of your fixed religious, ideological and philo-
 sophical dogmas which make you into will-less slaves of your belief in a god, tin god or human being whom
 you raise to the status of a divinity, wherethrough you suppress yourselves and hinder the rise up to the high
 evolution of the consciousness and exterminate every possibility of the consciousness-development.

### #454 (Chapter 28)

 If you are human beings who know the truth and the creational laws and recommendations in their mode of functioning, then you also understand therein the great Creation-idea; and if you adapt the right attitude, then
only the truth of all truth serves you – which alone proceeds from out of the Creation Universal Consciousness
– and hence also the way of the truth to the rise up to the consciousness-evolution, because you fulfil the Creation-given laws and recommendations and therefore live rightly.

### #455 (Chapter 28)

 And if you follow the Creation-idea and thus the truth of all truth, then you do not squirm remorsefully, knee-
 lingly, prayingly, beggingly, submissively, sanctimoniously, hypocritically and beseechingly before your god, tin
 god or idolised human being, because if you live in accordance with the Creation-idea and the Creation-given
 laws and recommendations, then you live practising it in a fresh, joyful and pure activity; therefore you do not
 beg whiningly and beseechingly for the effective truth of all truth, rather you go through life seeingly and joy-
 fully, and you recognise reality and live in consideration and fulfilment of the creational laws and recommen-
 dations and therefore in responsible fullness with regard to the consciousness-evolution.

### #456 (Chapter 28)

 And if you live in this wise, then your life will look entirely different from how you have so far seen and lived
 it, namely in accordance with the truth, law-fulfilling and well disposed towards the recommendations, much
 freer and more beautiful with which you stand in the midst of the Creation Universal Consciousness as corre-
 sponds to the Creation-idea.

### #457 (Chapter 28)

 Finally and really accept the truth as it is given to you through the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, through the
 ‹Goblet of the Truth›; and do not take everything as a picture and imagination but as true reality and implicit-
 ness and in place of the hazy schemes of your belief in your gods, tin gods, angles, saints and human beings
 whom you deify and put on an equal footing with your fabulated gods and tin gods.

### #458 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore learn to recognise the truth and to follow it, because only through doing so do you learn about the love of the Creation Universal Consciousness as well as the thereout resulting laws and recommendations
which you shall follow, because only therein is the way in yourselves given, the way that leads to the height
of your consciousness-evolution which is anchored in the primeval law of the Creation as constant motion.

### #459 (Chapter 28)

 If you look around, you human beings of Earth, you can see and recognise how you shall really live, because
 if you go around with open senses, then it is not difficult for you to recognise the primeval laws of the contin-
 uing motion of the Creation Universal Consciousness and all its creations, creatures and everything existent;
 and if you make an effort to pay attention to everything around you in a right wise, then you reveal multi-
 farious secrets which are hidden in the creational laws and recommendations and hence also in the Creation-
 idea.

### #460 (Chapter 28)

 Know that in the Creation Universal Consciousness the motion is a fundamental law in which is included every-
 thing that has ever been conceived and created by it.

### #461 (Chapter 28)

 The motion is therefore the fundamental and primeval law of the Creation Universal Consciousness and all its
 creations, i.e. created creations and everything existent, so hence this law is also valid for you human beings
 of Earth, but you have ignored the law of the right motion and use it wrongly.

### #462 (Chapter 28)

 Already when the Creation had created its idea, the primeval law of the motion was created in it, through
 which, since the very beginning, everything was formed and continues to be formed, because the unceasing
 motion is the becoming as well as the preservation and the passing as well as the re-becoming of all things
 and everything happening in the entire realm of the Creation Universal Consciousness.

### #463 (Chapter 28)

 This means that also you human beings of Earth cannot, in the midst of the all-life-giving motion, be observed and considered as an exception amongst all the creations, i.e. created creations, creatures and everything exis-
tent created by the Creation Universal Consciousness, because you cannot stand still in the Creation-given and
incessantly continuing motion, and you cannot go your own ways without you taking harm for yourselves.

### #464 (Chapter 28)

 There are very many amongst you who only relax and lead a comfortable life and who regard comfortableness
 and idleness as the crowning moment of your life, especially in your older years when you particularly ought
 to be striving for the life-wisdom in order to pass it on to the younger generation.

### #465 (Chapter 28)

 But what you achieve with the comfortableness and with the idleness is pure poison for the evolution of your
 consciousness, namely the beginning of the end of your consciousness-evolution which you shall create con-
 sciously.

### #466 (Chapter 28)

 If you rightly open your eyes and your senses for your life, for your evolution and for your surrounding area, then
 you recognise thereby a great deal, perceive a lot of things and gain cognitions, cognisance and knowledge,
 out of which practical experience and the living of the same and ultimately wisdom results, through which you
 advance the evolution of your consciousness; and if you are alert and attentive, then you recognise in every-
 thing a distinct reason and a Creation-given law in all happenings.

### #467 (Chapter 28)

 If you really only sit and rest in your life and only want to rest from all your activity until the end of your life,
 then you push away the rhythmic law of the always valid motion as it is given in all things through the Creation
 Universal Consciousness.

### #468 (Chapter 28)

 And through your comfortableness and idleness with regard to the evolution of the consciousness, you push
 yourselves away from the rhythmic motions of the Creation, just like an overripe fruit falling from the tree; and
 the reason is that all the swinging and motion around you is much stronger than the motion in yourselves,
 which ought to conform to the outer swinging waves, i.e. motions.

### #469 (Chapter 28)

 And you all amongst you human beings of Earth who act in this wrong wise, you fall ill and tire out because your own swinging waves, your own motions and your conscious awakeness cannot keep pace with the ruling
motion of the Creation Universal Consciousness; truly, you can only stay fresh, joyful and healthy, if you inte- grate yourselves into and adjust yourselves to the rhythm of the creational-universal motion.

### #470 (Chapter 28)

 The term ‹interruption› alone means stagnation, i.e. standstill and lets intuit the great law of the Creation-given
 motion, in which the becoming and passing and the re-becoming are included.

### #471 (Chapter 28)

 Motion is upbuilding and preservation, i.e. creating and preserving as well as further development right up to
 a distinct destination.

### #472 (Chapter 28)

 But those amongst you all who literally want to sit and rest in your life, you have no destination in front of you
 and you yourselves set the end in your volition, wherethrough you withdraw yourselves from the creation-
 swinging, i.e. the Creation-determined motion and are no longer capable of any consciousness-evolution, and
 this in spite of the fact that the evolution of the consciousness has no end; you, however, hinder the natural motion
 of this evolution and ignore the enduring development which as motion is given in the law of the Creation-
 idea, but you cannot do this without suffering harm, because the ignoring leads to the stagnation which hits
 you with blatant truth-unknowledgeness.

### #473 (Chapter 28)

 And as an allegory to show that those amongst you lead a life in true joy and in the well-being who live in
 accordance with the truth and the creational laws and recommendations, the following is said: Those amongst
 you all who constantly have to labour hard for your earthly living with your hands, you are usually healthier
 and live to be older than those amongst you all who are, from their youth on, pamperingly protected and
 nursed in a careful kind; and those amongst you all who were brought up in prosperity and do everything pos-
 sible for your body, your psyche and your nerves to make sure that you can live comfortably without distur-
 bance and strain, it is you who are more quickly exposed to the outer signs of the oncoming old age than those
 who are not endowed with earthly goods and who must fulfil their existence in the sweat of their face.

### #474 (Chapter 28)

 Those amongst you who lead a work-rich life in which there is no unnecessary exaggeration and no frantic
 pathological craving for the amassing of material treasures as well as no self-emphasising, you have a good
 life; but those amongst you who make yourselves the slaves of such pathological craving, you suffer from con-
 stant disturbance and therefore act completely disharmonious in the creational motion, i.e. swinging wave;
 therefore there is also here a golden middle-way for each of you, so you can live in the swinging wave of the
 Creation on Earth rightly and for yourselves in a content and favourable wise; and consider thereby, what you
 do, you shall do it totally and amply, and leave nothing to be desired, because the greatest terribleness against
 a harmonious fulfilment of the life is a one-sidedness.

### #475 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, a work-rich life without the fulfilment of the consciousness-evolution is of no advantage to you,
 because your earthly body may well swing with the motion of the Creation, however your consciousness lies
 dormant, stands still and stagnates in terms of the evolution.

### #476 (Chapter 28)

 But if your consciousness does not move forward in an evolving wise – and indeed in harmony with the swing -
 ing waves of the Creation, i.e. with the Creation-determined motion which pulses through everything – then
 no preservation and hardening of your body takes place through your labour, but instead it ages quickly, wears
 down and becomes exhausted; because the truth is that your material body must be in harmony with your
 consciousness-evolution.

### #477 (Chapter 28)

 If your material body lacks the energy and power of your consciousness because the latter stagnates, then this
 standstill holds back the blossoming of the body and hinders it from keeping healthy, because the body, with-
 out the consciousness-evolution, uses itself up in its own swinging waves, i.e. motions, wilts and decays; there-
 fore it can no longer renew itself, because it lacks the power-source, the motions, i.e. swinging waves of the
 evolution of the consciousness; therefore it is useless, if you move only physically, but leave the evolutionary
 motion of your consciousness out of your attention.

### #478 (Chapter 28)

 It is useless, if you do no work and make no effort concerning your consciousness-evolution, and indeed also
 then, if, to exercise your body, you regularly undergo fitness trainings and go for walks and do all sorts of other
 things to keep your body in shape, because truly, it ages quickly nevertheless and decays, if it does not live in
 the same swinging wave, i.e. motion with the evolving consciousness.

### #479 (Chapter 28)

 The consciousness-motion, i.e. the swinging wave of the consciousness is determined through the conscious
 effort of the learning and the thereout resulting development, i.e. evolution, which is reached through the
 achievement of a destination consisting of distinct factors and which moves the consciousness, because energy
 and power are transferred to the body and the body transfers again its energy and power as well as persever-
 ance to the consciousness.

### #480 (Chapter 28)

 The fulfilment of the consciousness must not be searched for in the material, but rather in its evolution, from
 which also the spirit-form gains evolutionary benefit, and this benefit carries itself into the Creation universal
 consciousness and is in turn beneficial for its evolution; this however is a fulfilment of the consciousness-evo-
 lution which is far beyond all earthly matters and which is carried far beyond your earthly existence.
 
### #481 (Chapter 28)

 The fulfilment of your consciousness, the evolution, must live in you, and be dynamic in you, because other-
 wise it has nothing in common with your consciousness.

### #482 (Chapter 28)

 But the truth is that you human beings of Earth of today no longer know what your consciousness actually is, because on account of the wrong teachings of your wrong prophets, religions, ideologies and philosophies you
have put the spirit, i.e. the spirit-form in its place, which you erroneously and wrongly assume to be responsible
for your ideas, thoughts, feelings as well as your activity, actions and doing; but that is not the truth, because
not your spirit, i.e. not your spirit-form is responsible for this, but your consciousness, for which and for whose
entire activity and the thereout resulting intellect and rationality you yourselves bear the full responsibility.

### #483 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form is not identical with your consciousness and is not of an earthly, material
 kind but rather of a pure creational-spiritual nature and untouchable for you; nevertheless, you erroneously
 assume that your consciousness-given intellect and your rationality are of a spiritual nature, and with this
 assumption you cling to a traditional irrational teaching of a religious, ideological and philosophical kind which
 finishes off your intellect and your rationality and brings about a downfall into non-understanding and truth-
 unknowledge, to which you cling and cannot perceive and recognise the real truth.

### #484 (Chapter 28)

 Your earthly existence requires the fulfilment of the life-sense which consists of bringing your consciousness-
 evolution to the highest possible level of love, knowledge and wisdom; that is the sense of the life and the ful-
 filment, into which all furthering values of the consciousness-development must be brought for the purpose
 of this, that therethrough also your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form can take over these high values, to ultimately
 bring them into the Creation Universal Consciousness which as a result also evolves; but be conscious that all
 love, all knowledge and all wisdom, which you create for yourselves and which go over into your spirit, i.e.
 your spirit-form, are always only relatively absolutely fully developed as are also the love, the knowledge and
 the wisdom of the Creation Universal Consciousness; truly, there is nothing absolutely fully developed but only
 relatively absolutely fully developed, because everything is in constant motion and develops always further and
 higher, including you with your consciousness, your spirit, i.e. your spirit-form in its spiritual-creational energy
 and power, and the Creation Universal Consciousness in its spiritual-energetic BEING; that is the truth which you
 must realise, recognise and know, because this truth is an eternity-value, an all-time-value and hence nothing
 that is only passing.

### #485 (Chapter 28)

 And if you want to act, and howsoever you want to act, whatever you are striving for, and whatever you are
 making an effort for, always ask yourselves first whether the whole corresponds to the effective relative truth,
 because truth too is not absolutely fully developed, but is always only relatively given, and indeed because the
 one truth always entails the next following truth; because truly the truth is also in swinging motion, hence it
 constantly widens if new knowledge and new wisdom come to it; therefore also the real truth of all truth is
 not absolutely but only relatively absolutely fully developed, although for you human beings it nevertheless
 builds the highest value of the currently fathomable and reachable truth which however through the learning
 can in turn be worked through with further knowledge and further wisdom to a new relative highest level of
 the truth.

### #486 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, also the real truth of all truth is in constant swinging motion, because a widened knowledge and a widened
 wisdom lead to new truth-cognitions, each of which in its relative highest level builds the real truth of all truth;
 therefore, the real truth of all truth keeps widening further and further, and indeed entirely according to the
 increasing evolution which also always reaches its highest relative level, which in turn reaches a new relative
 highest level when new knowledge and thereout resulting wisdom comes to it; the evolution of love, knowl-
 edge and wisdom as well as the real truth of all truth thus never come to an end, but continue to increase ever
 further and higher into all duration of the endlessness.

### #487 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore, if you want to act consciously, no matter what you are striving and endeavouring for, then ask your-
 selves about the true relative value and the relative real truth of all truth which results out of the whole, so
 that you may really find everything in the right wise and know that every real truth of all truth as well as every
 value of the knowledge and the wisdom is always only a level that leads to the next higher level, because
 through swinging motion everything constantly develops further and never comes to an end in all endlessness
 of the endless duration; and all this is not all too difficult to understand, if only you make a conscious and wil-
 ling effort to gain the understanding.

### #488 (Chapter 28)

 Do not rely on the wrong teachings of the religions, ideologies and philosophies and not on the useless striv-
 ing for pseudo-cognitions of the same kind as they are presented to you, because truly, they are a hindrance
 to the climb up to your consciousness-evolution, because they prevent the truth-fathoming in you and bring
 the motion to a standstill, and as a result each progress and each development is thwarted and cannot be
 brought to success.

### #489 (Chapter 28)

 Also with regard to your sciences you shall thoroughly think about them, because through them you cannot unfold your swings of the motions, rather they are badly curtailed and destroyed through them, because they
run after wrong cognitions and do not perceive and do not recognise the real truth of the Creation Universal Consciousness and its laws and recommendations nor their effects, but instead try to explain everything only on the basis of their scientific-physical cognitions, which relate to the purely material factors and do not pay attention to, nor understand, and consequently also cannot explain, all the fine-fluidal and spirit-energetical.

### #490 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, the whole truth of all truth does not lie in the material sciences alone, but fundamentally and first and
 foremost in the spirit-energetical realm which is created through the Creation Universal Consciousness; and
 the truth of all truth does not lie in complicated physical, religious, ideological, political and philosophical for-
 mulas, but in the simplicity of all things as they are given through the creational laws and recommendations;
 and therefore, the true simplicity also lies in the thoughts and feelings and in the truthly activity of you human
 beings which is in accordance with the Creation, just as the greatness lies in you yourselves through which you
 unfold the might of your responsibility and integrate it into the following of the laws and recommendations
 of the Creation Universal Consciousness, which you shall strive for consciously and in love; but you humankind
 of Earth, you have turned away from the creational truth and instead turned to your religions, ideologies,
 philosophies and your material sciences and believe yourselves great in your purely material rationality- and
 intellect-based knowledge.

### #491 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you have bound yourselves to your material sciences and your belief in gods, tin gods and idolised human
 beings and have obstructed yourselves against the real truth of the existence of the Creation and its laws and
 recommendations.

### #492 (Chapter 28)

 Consider this, of what use is it to you, if you squander away the time of your earthly life with the attempt of
 wanting to find out when and how such a tiny creature as a louse came into being and how long it will con-
 tinue to exist for, if you thereby completely forget to research the creational laws and recommendations and
 to live according to them and according to the truth which is given therein; truly, your entire material searching
 and researching is of no use to you, if you leave the creational-spiritual energy and power and hence the high-
 est possible truth of all truth out of your attention.

### #493 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you must seriously and thoroughly examine one thing after the other to find out which value it brings
 you as excellence.

### #494 (Chapter 28)

 And if you examine everything very accurately, then you will suddenly recognise that everything therein that
 today does not take place according to the creational laws and recommendations breaks down like a useless
 house of cards, and shows you that your earthly existence, which is given to you as a gift for your conscious-
 ness-evolution, is, with regard to the evolution, the learning of the truth, the creating of the love, knowledge
 and wisdom, truthfully much too precious to leave unused even for a single minute.

### #495 (Chapter 28)

 Do not wallow in your vanity and your gambling, because they have nothing in them through which you would
 be able to raise yourselves evolutively and to the effective truth, because vanity and gambling are only empty
 and dead in themselves.

### #496 (Chapter 28)

 Do not be megalomaniacal and do not assume that you could raise yourselves up to the Creation Universal
 Consciousness, because even if you become very knowing and wise and can manipulate the life and change
 it through genetic engineering, you are nevertheless only creations, i.e. created creations of the Creation
 Universal Consciousness, and you will never get beyond that as material human beings.

### #497 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, in the Creation Universal Consciousness, in which you live as its creations, you shall complete, in fulfil-
 ment of its laws and recommendations, actions and an activity of the evolution of your consciousness; there-
 fore, you shall step out of your delusion of your self-boastfulness and fulfil your duty.

### #498 (Chapter 28)

 If you look at and consider yourselves, then you are only like sounding ore with your wrong knowledge in the
 unknowledge of the effective creational truth of all truth, whereas your real existence should be an aliveness
 and a furthering of your evolutionary task.

### #499 (Chapter 28)

 And if you enjoy life and thankfully direct your senses upon it and upon the truth, then you stand higher than
 those who knowingly take apart their existence and unconcernedly go forth without recognising the greatness
 of the Creation.

### #500 (Chapter 28)

 Look around you, you human beings of Earth, because it depends on how you realise the life, your own activ- ity and your fellow human beings and what they mean to you in reality and what value they have for you.

### #501 (Chapter 28)

 And if you look at and consider your life, your activity and your fellow human beings, the nature and its life
 forms as well as the whole world, then you find only little that is really worthy of a true humankind, because
 you have destroyed everything – your honour and dignity, your true being human, your life in accordance with
 the creational laws and recommendations, your forests, grasslands, wetlands, meadows, your creeks, rivers,
 streams, lakes and seas as well as your climate, just as you have exterminated many animals, birds, fishes and
 all sorts of creatures and continue to do so through your unintellect and irrationality and your continued cul-
 tivation of the all-destroying overpopulation.

### #502 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you are like unusable servants in a paradisiacal garden in which you destroy and eliminate everything, instead of taking care of it, building it up, and bringing it to the blossoming and bearing of good fruits.

### #503 (Chapter 28)

 You waste your lifetime with vanity, egoism, hatred, jealousy, unpeace, unfreedom, and disharmony, with strife,
 war, lying and deception as well as with murder, manslaughter, torture, punishment, destruction and extermi-
 nation, but also with senseless gambling, thereby adorning your high ability, which lies in you as a creational
 gift, with cheap bric-à-brac, with wrong wishes, hopes and desires of all kinds.

### #504 (Chapter 28)

 Wake up, you human beings of Earth, so that you can create for yourselves a worthy consciousness-evolution
 and no longer go through life desperately poor with regard to your truth-knowledge; create for yourselves –
 through the finding and following of the truth of all truth – an inexhaustible treasure during your earthly life,
 so that you are in yourselves like king and emperor and reign over your existence with the sceptre of the true
 love, the knowledge and the wisdom.

### #505 (Chapter 28)

 Do not remain desperately poor in your truth-knowledge and do not think that the material knowledge alone
 is sufficient to further the evolution of your consciousness, because if you think in this wise, then you are un-
 worthy of the life and are king and emperor of your own inner darkness and unknowledge, so you childishly
 wield a sceptre of the dalliance and illusion and put on a crown of the arrogance and vanity and therewith
 prove your lack of intelligence.

### #506 (Chapter 28)

 What you necessarily have to research is, first and foremost, only all that which you need for the recognition
 of the truth in yourselves and for the evolutive climb up of your consciousness, in which case you need the
 movement of the learning which is of most important significance for the furtherance of your truth-finding
 and consciousness-evolution.

### #507 (Chapter 28)

 In everything that you go about, do and undertake, you must ask yourselves what advantage and value the
 whole brings for you yourselves as well as for your fellow human beings.

### #508 (Chapter 28)

 And it is necessary that you recognise your destination and fully adhere to it, so that you comprehend that you
 have to follow and fulfil it in your life.

### #509 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, if you fulfil a great action on your world, then you will be honoured, provided that you are not envied
 for it; such glory usually stays with you till your earthly end and often even beyond it over decades, centuries
 or even millennia; but that is a pure human work of the remembrance and often even of the glorification, and
 indeed not seldom with regard to a wrong understanding of the fact that human beings and their actions and
 their activity shall not be glorified, but only kept in honourable remembrance and be thought of in dignity,
 wherethrough no glorification and no person- or human-cult shall be practised.

### #510 (Chapter 28)

 A glorification of human beings, gods and tin gods is just as perverse as a glorification of the Creation Universal
 Consciousness which indeed represents in its entire BEING a magnificence, but shall not be glorified neverthe-
 less; used in connection with the Creation Universal Consciousness, the term magnificence does not mean glo-
 rification, but grace, beauty, true love, fairness and attraction, whereas glorification means worship, servitude,
 humility, cheering and adulation.

### #511 (Chapter 28)

 Glorification is the fruit of your wrong human view, your wrong assessment and erroneous evaluation of the
 reality which you have made into a tradition and transfer to all and everything that you deem to be higher than
 yourselves.

### #512 (Chapter 28)

 Your circling motion is extremely sluggish, which is why the interactions are only triggered slowly and not with easiness, so they generally only ensue step-by-step and no longer let you recognise the causes that lead to the
interaction from which you very often have to suffer, because they are of a negative, bad and evil nature.

### #513 (Chapter 28)

 The interactions which arise out of your motions of your thoughts and feelings as well as out of your actions,
 deeds and out of your entire activity are always measured according to their viewpoints; through your human
 view you let so many thoughts, feelings, actions, deeds and many activities appear great, even though they
 are truthly insignificant and worthless, whereas you do not value so many other things, in which truthful great-
 ness inheres, in their good and great excellence.

### #514 (Chapter 28)

 The higher you develop the consciousness-based evolution, the easier and clearer your understanding and the
 quicker your reward of the knowledge and the wisdom will be, because your human consciousness rises faster
 and faster in its evolution, if you consciously have a good volition thereto; and if this good volition is given in
 you, then even a single small and really good action pulls you in that moment upwards into the highest inner
 heights of the joy, peace, freedom and harmony; and you can make use thereof in remembrance, out of which
 it follows that you climb higher and higher and that you acquire new knowledge and new wisdom, together
 with your in you growing true love to yourselves, to your fellow human beings, to the life, to the Creation
 Universal Consciousness and to all its created creations, laws and recommendations and to everything existing
 in every form.

### #515 (Chapter 28)

 And if you reach this state, then you can no longer remain in stagnation, because you make an effort, in a
 conscious, willing and incessant wise, to follow the motion of the consciousness-evolution in order to rise con-
 tinuously higher in it; however if you stand still in the ripening of your consciousness, then the ripeness will
 begin to rot, because it is not supplied with new energy and power, instead these are used up again and there-
 through a decay-process is triggered.
 
### #516 (Chapter 28)

 If you human beings of Earth see yourselves in the true reason of your existence, then you are equal to a fruit
 of the Creation Universal Consciousness which you yourselves must bring to the ripening in your conscious-
 ness-evolution, just like a fruit on a tree for which the tree is the creational existence, although the fruit must
 nevertheless bring itself to the ripeness.

### #517 (Chapter 28)

 Consider however, that as fruit of the Creation Universal Consciousness, you are not the Creation Universal
 Consciousness itself but always remain its fruit, but you carry the capability in you to develop yourselves to the
 ripening of your consciousness-evolution in order to therewith enrich the tiny part of the Creation in you, i.e.
 your spirit, and this spirit in turn enriches the Creation itself, but still you are not the Creation itself.

### #518 (Chapter 28)

 Your consciousness-evolution is the sense of your existence, and this sense is integrated into the automatic
 impulsion and course of the universal laws of the Creation through which you are given the capability to be
 evolutively active in your consciousness yourselves in order to fulfil the sense and therewith the mission of your
 life.

### #519 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, despite the automatic impulsion to the fulfilment of the life-sense as it is given through the laws of the
 Creation, you human beings are nevertheless free in your will, actions, deeds, activity, determining and decid-
 ing, so the laws of the Creation do not impose any coercion on you.

### #520 (Chapter 28)

 In this freedom of your will, you are not only given the determining and deciding with regard to your conscious-
 ness-evolution, but also the motion of your procreation which you shall however only use for the preservation
 of your species and not for the excessive population growth, because it is also your task to protect, preserve
 and further your earth and its nature and climate as well as all animals and other creatures, not however to
 destroy them as you are doing through the vermin-like cultivation of your humankind.

### #521 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, as human beings of Earth you have to fulfil a great task with regard to your consciousness-evolution and
 your world and its nature, climate and all animals/creatures; and know: There is nothing in the Creation
 Universal Consciousness which would be integrated into a task without motion and would not be integrated
 into the Creation-given laws and recommendations, so even in the putrefaction there is motion, furtherance
 and benefit, because therethrough, through the passing, new things emerge again.

### #522 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore, be heedful in all things and be conscious that you also hold yourselves in the height attained, once
 you have climbed up in your consciousness-evolution; you must not take a rest and not allow any thoughts
 and feelings to arise of you having done enough for some time, but instead you must continuously move on
 like the hovering falcon in the air, which in doing so saves itself from the fall and at the same time looks out
 for new food.

### #523 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, in everything lies simple creational laws and recommendations, in the fine-fluidal and in the high-fine-
 fluidal spiritual as well as in the most coarse-material, and indeed these laws and recommendations cannot be
 changed or bent; they act and must be paid attention to, and indeed both in the thin shining of the fine- and
 high-fine-fluidal, in which the acting is lighter and faster, and in the inert and coarse-substantial, in which it is
 correspondingly slower, but in either case they are in constant motion and indeed it is so.

### #524 (Chapter 28)

 There is such a simplicity given in the effects and outcoming effects of the creational laws and recommenda-
 tions themselves that no special education is required to find it, to correctly recognise it and to comprehend it,
 because only a healthy intellect and a clear rationality suffice thereto.

### #525 (Chapter 28)

 Each of you human beings of Earth has a creationally given capability thereto, if only you want to set it con-
 sciously in motion and perceive it and use it; and truly, every perception is very easy, if you consciously, heed-
 fully and attentively observe, because you only make it heavy for yourselves through your knowledge-conceit,
 i.e. through your imagined knowledge-superiority, as a result of which you like to form in an overly boastful
 wise the simplest thing in academic and abstract terms and words in order to shine and to appear brilliant and
 to boast in front of your fellow human beings; and you do not realise that through doing so you make your-
 selves ridiculous and to fools, disgrace yourselves and thus reveal your effective lack of intelligence and your
 unintellect; it does not come to your mind to explain the simplicity of a thing as simply as it is, using simple
 words, and that all your fellow human beings – even those who are academically not highly educated – under-
 stand everything exactly; and truly, that is megalomania through which you clumsily splash around, in the mat-
 ter of the truth of all truth, as in clear water, and at the same time, through your bumptiousness, you do not
 realise how you trample dirt and rubbish into everything and make the originally clear water into a muddy
 sludge, in which nothing is no longer clearly recognisable

### #526 (Chapter 28)

 Many amongst you human beings of Earth live in a completely wrong learning and as a result you neglect to
 fill in your assigned to you place in the Creation Universal Consciousness as well as in its laws, recommenda-
 tions, created creations and in everything existent as a jointly swinging and rightly acting Wesenheit.

### #527 (Chapter 28)

 The creational laws and recommendations are so formed that you shall live according to them and come to
 your senses through following them, so that you may fulfil your task with regard to your consciousness-evolu-
 tion and thus give enrichment to your spirit and through this spirit to the Creation itself; but if you do not do
 this, then you will become rotting fruit, and will putrefy and decompose.

### #528 (Chapter 28)

 Through the effects of the creational laws and recommendations it always proves what you move rightly in
 your existence or what you act upon wrongly, because the effects arise according to how you act.
 
### #529 (Chapter 28)

 You amongst you human beings of Earth who struggle with things through which no climb up through evo-
 lution of the consciousness can take place, you are wasting your time, energy and power, because you devi-
 ate from the motion of the creational swinging waves through which the healthy and necessary harmony is
 given you, namely because you disturb yourselves in this harmony.

### #530 (Chapter 28)

 Learn, therefore, to recognise in perception, the motion of the simplicity of the creational laws and recommen-
 dations, and to appreciate and use them in their entire greatness; but if you do not act in this wise, then you
 will shatter your own activity with regard to your evolution and the finding of the effective real truth of all
 truth, because on the way of your development you stand in the way of yourselves and you flush yourselves
 away as a pernicious hindrance.

### #531 (Chapter 28)

 Learn that the motion in all things is the most important factor of each development, which is given in the
 Creation Universal Consciousness, because it itself has, as a motion of an idea of the Primal-Creation, arisen
 from out of itself as an at all times stirring motion and is kept in it and constantly renewed.

### #532 (Chapter 28)

 And just as the progress of the motion is in the Creation itself, so the progress of the motion must also be in
 yourselves as well as in your world, for which you must constantly be concerned.

### #533 (Chapter 28)

 You human beings of Earth who have been swinging in the laws and recommendations of the Creation which
 have been given since the primal beginning, you shall not dally away your time by going through life in wrong
 intellectual and rational rumination, nor shall you destroy the motion of the development that is given through
 the creational energy and power, through which you, together with the truth-finding and its following, further
 your consciousness-evolution.

### #534 (Chapter 28)

 It is urgent that you finally fathom all conceivable creational laws and recommendations, learn about them and
 direct yourselves according to them, because if you do not use your earthly activity to fathom, to find and to
 follow the truth of all truth and hence reach a high consciousness-based evolutionary fulfilment, then you can-
 not truly exist in the life, because it inevitably must break down and bring terrible disadvantage in accordance
 with the effects of the laws and recommendations of the Creation, so the true love, peace, freedom and har-
 mony as well as joy and happiness pulverise in you, just like a stepped-on, overripe and poisonous puffball that
 wildly spreads its spores and infiltrates its surroundings with them; this happening is entirely factual and simple,
 but for you human beings of Earth the effect is of tremendous dreadfulness, because just as the poisonous
 puffball spreads its poisonous spores, so you create in you and amongst your whole humankind, through your
 truth-foreignness and your truth-unknowledge and through your non-following of the Creation-given laws
 and recommendations, hatred, crime, torture, murder and manslaughter, terror, unfreedom, unpeace and dis-
 harmony as well as wars, strife, jealousy and a felonious overpopulation through which you destroy the climate
 and the nature of your world and call forth all evil and all conceivable Ausartung.

### #535 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, for you human beings of Earth, there remains only one thing to do, namely to fathom the creational laws
 and recommendations and to absolutely direct yourselves according to them; and if you find and recognise the
 truth of all truth and therewith also the effects of the Creation-given laws and recommendations, then follow
 them; and if you therethrough reach a certain evolutionary height in terms of your consciousness, then bind
 yourselves to adhering to them through making a continual effort, because otherwise it goes quickly downwards
 again with you.

### #536 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, each one of you who cannot keep himself or herself on his or her step must leave that step again
 backwards, because each of you can only be what and who he or she really is, whereas what he or she was
 before is of no significance because, through the motion of the time, it has flowed into the past.

### #537 (Chapter 28)

 That which was, is gone and is not recallable again for all the future time, because it is a past change and is
 no longer existent.

### #538 (Chapter 28)

 Only what is, has validity and value as does everything that arises out of what exists, and this applies in all eter-
 nity and all-great-time.

### #539 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore, you human beings of Earth, educate yourselves – and indeed in your present and in your future –
 in every kind and wise always through your real creational nature, which is given to you, so that you bring your
 self-created form of the inner nature, your individuality, to bear according to the creational ideal.

### #540 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, without constant motion in every respect of the good and positive there is no stability for you in your exis- tence; and truly, you cannot bask in the glow of your ancestors, because instead of glow there was blindness
amongst them too just as there is amongst you, therefore you must first bring everything to glow and polish
it up; thereby each one of you stands for himself or herself, because the wife cannot do anything for her hus-
band nor can he do anything for her, so the children cannot do anything for their parents nor the parents for
their children, just as no fellow human being can do anything for the other one, because each one of you must
do everything in and for himself or herself alone, because each one of you only has his or her present to him-
self or herself; and that you fall into rumination over this and over yourselves does not bring any benefit for
you, because you only have to recognise that everything is anchored in this wise in the effects of the creational
laws and recommendations which corresponds to the strength of the character and of all virtues of the
Creation Universal Consciousness, so that each one of you and each life form in general has exactly the same
rights and his or her own responsibility to bear just like everyone else; so you shall not fall in senseless rumi- nation over this, but instead each one of you shall turn to the unchangeable truth as it is pre-given through the Creation and its laws and recommendations.

### #541 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, if you spend your days on Earth ruminating over yourselves then you will never be able to climb upwards in the evolution of your consciousness, because you are held back through the senseless rumination.

### #542 (Chapter 28)

 Do not assume that a rumination over yourselves and a pure observation of yourselves is something very spe-
 cial, great and valueful, because that is not the case at all and does not bring you further in your conscious-
 ness-evolution.

### #543 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, you have many terms and words for your ruminating over yourselves, but they all mantle the actual sense
 of the case, namely to get to know yourselves in all your thoughts, feelings, passions, habits, capabilities and
 possibilities etc., in order to get to the core of the case which is given therein that you use all perceptions,
 cognitions, and cognisances as well as the knowledge, the practical experiences and the living of them, as well
 as the wisdom resulting out of it all for turning to the truth of all truth, to the Creation and its laws and recom-
 mendations, which are to be fulfilled and through which you really learn and advance your evolution of the
 consciousness.

### #544 (Chapter 28)

 But you are many amongst you, you who do not use your thoughts and feelings in an evolutionary kind and
 wise, but instead let them deteriorate in senseless rumination; you wrongly ruminate around in remorse and
 humility and you try, through rumination, to discover your errors and to find a way to avoid them; but there is
 no progress in this, because the constant rumination leads to no success and to no end, because the rumina-
 tion remains a rumination.

### #545 (Chapter 28)

 What you have to do is not a ruminating, but a conscious using of your thoughts and feelings as well as your
 intellect and your rationality, through which you must search for the way of the truth in yourselves which is
 the truth and the culmination-point itself, so that through it you find the truth of all truth which is given in the
 Creation Universal Consciousness as well as in its laws and recommendations; and only then, if you take this
 way and give up your constant rumination, will you create in you a state of true love, joy, peace, freedom and
 harmony, because this is how it is pre-given through the effects of the laws and recommendations of the
 Creation.

### #546 (Chapter 28)

 So go the right way, however never go the wrong way of the rumination which does not lead up to the truth
 and consciousness-evolution but down into the darkness of the knowledge-untruth, not-knowing and irre-
 sponsibility, because through rumination you bind yourselves to something in which you go around in circles
 and never find a fulfilment, because you inevitably only look at yourselves in the wise, so that you only perceive
 those things about yourselves that seem pleasant to you, and this prevents you from striving for and reaching
 higher fulfilments in terms of the evolution of your consciousness.

### #547 (Chapter 28)

 While ruminating you become morose and lose your laugh which in its open and honest joy and heartiness is
 the biggest and strongest enemy of the darkness of your thoughts and feelings.

### #548 (Chapter 28)

 With this, not the laughing in schadenfreude is meant, but the releasing laugh of one’s own joy and kindness,
 as it arises through one's own inner freedom, one's own inner peace and one's own harmony, because open
 and evolutionary thoughts and feelings are given which connect themselves with the real truth and the cre -
 ational laws and recommendations.

### #549 (Chapter 28)

 Whereas open thoughts and feelings connect themselves through the truth in an evolutionary wise with the
 reality and create in you joy, love, happiness, harmony, peace, freedom and kindness, the rumination has the
 opposite effect in that it presses you down, keeps you down and pulls you further and further down into that
 darkness in which you live in tribulation and where you create all the terrible things of the Ausartungen, such
 as hatred, revenge, retaliation, strife, jealousy, war, murder, torture, felonious acts, criminality, ruin, destruction
 and elimination.

### #550 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, if you continuously ruminate instead of directing your thoughts and feelings upon the real truth and your
 evolutionary progress, then you have no conscious volition to really experience and live the truth, because in
 your rumination, you are only wallowing in vanity, wrong ambition and in your conceit, in your haughtiness,
 in your supposed superiority and in your being presumptuous.

### #551 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, if you give in to your rumination, then this is not a longing for the truth about yourselves as well as with
 regard to the Creation and the effects of its laws and recommendations, but rather it is your own pure patho-
 logical craving for overbearingness which creates in you the motivation for your rumination, and indeed in a
 wise that is re-igniting the whole time and again and uncontrolledly continuing it.

### #552 (Chapter 28)

 Your rumination over yourselves is pure self-torment, in which you create and endure over and over again the
 same thoughts and feelings in a rotating wise, while you observe everything with fervour and even effective
 fanaticism and are not able to bring the alternating pros and cons under control.

### #553 (Chapter 28)

 All these processes of your rumination get into your psyche both as vexation and as consolation, as a result of which it gets into confusion and via the consciousness brings forth again wrong thoughts and feelings and you
wrongly assume that something has been ‹overcome› once more, which is, truthly, however not so, but only
springs from a mood of self-gratification and does not mean that you have advanced or developed one step.

### #554 (Chapter 28)

 The whole corresponds truthly to a wrong self-ascertainment, because it only ascertains what is thought up as
 imagination, therefore such an ascertainment is nothing more than a self-deception.

### #555 (Chapter 28)

 In reality, through this, not a single step of the progress and cognition with regard to yourselves and with
 regard to the truth of all truth as well as the creational laws and recommendations is reached, but only a self-
 deception; and truthly, you make this error over and over again, even if you wrongly assume that it is no longer
 the same error, because usually when an error is resolved this leads to a progress, since the erroneousness is
 reduced more and more until it ultimately is resolved; however, the error that you make with regard to the entire
 connections of your rumination is thus unchanged always the same and only changes in its form, although it
 neither minimises nor reduces, if you do not give up and free yourselves from your rumination.

### #556 (Chapter 28)

 So if you do not end your rumination, you will never get ahead, even if according to your own wrong obser-
 vation you assume that you are overcoming one error after the other; truthly, in your rumination you always
 go only in circles around yourselves while the long-established fundamental problem continuously expands and
 continues to create new forms.

### #557 (Chapter 28)

 If you always observe only yourselves ruminatively, then you resemble the mythological Hydra, a serpent-like
 monster with nine heads which grow back as soon as they have been hacked off, so that the fight never ends
 and one can never gain victory.

### #558 (Chapter 28)

 Just as the mythological Hydra grows an identical new head, so do your thoughts and feelings of the same
 kind, if you indulge in the rumination, which is in any case always senseless; however, what you can achieve
 with your rumination, is unreality, because as a rule rumination leads to assuming and visionarily seeing things
 that are not reconcilable with the clear reality and are thus purest illusions, through which you also regard, in
 a delusion-based wise, fabulated godheads, tin gods, angels, saints and demons as non-coarse-substantial
 natures, to whom you fall prey in confused and irrational belief.

### #559 (Chapter 28)

 Consider, only when you joyfully, freely and consciously strive for the high culmination point of the truth-find-
 ing, direct yourselves towards this destination and thereby do not have your thoughts and feelings constantly
 directed only upon yourselves, can you advance and reach the high culmination-point of the truth-recognition
 and truth-following.

### #560 (Chapter 28)

 And consider that you cannot make progress without throwbacks and that in your search for the truth and
 when following it you will keep falling, because making errors is unavoidable when learning and therefore you
 must become more and more attentive and heedful during your learning process; but with every throwback
 and fall you must rise again until you reach the security that keeps you from throwbacks and falls; that is the
 way which you as human beings must go, and upon which you must not be faint-hearted and must not be
 wailing and not be complaining, but instead you shall always newly and freshly turn towards the endeavour;
 and if you do that, then the moment will unexpectedly come when you suffer no more throwbacks and you
 no longer have to fear them, because you will have amply taken in everything that you have learned and
 because you amply follow the creational laws and recommendations.

### #561 (Chapter 28)

 Know however: you can only take in and follow the things to be learned by really perceiving everything and
 gaining thereout an effective cognition and the necessary cognisance as well as the knowledge thereout,
 which you must bring to your practical experience and then live it, out of which you then gain the essence,
 the true wisdom.

### #562 (Chapter 28)

 The observing alone is not enough, and neither is the ruminating, because this will not lead you to the real
 and true perception and hence also not to the developmental process up to the wisdom, because through
 observing alone, as well as through the senseless ruminating, you put yourselves outside of each truthly per-
 ception, outside of the cognition, cognisance, knowledge, experience and its living, as well as outside of the
 wisdom; through the observing alone as well as through the senseless ruminating you take apart and decon-
 struct everything because you look at everything as if it was something strange, instead of directing yoursel-
 ves fully and amply upon everything in a conscious and perceiving wise.

### #563 (Chapter 28)

 And when you look at yourselves in order to see yourselves how you really are, then you must not just simply observe yourselves, but instead you must remain neutral and stand outside of your thoughts and feelings,
because only then can you truthly consciously perceive yourselves in all things as they really are given in you.

### #564 (Chapter 28)

 If you fall prey to the rumination, then you only serve your intellect which you use to go around in circles, because through your intellect you hold back the entire developmental process from the real perception to the
wisdom, because you leave the rationality out of your attention which would let you perceive everything; you
do not let the effects of all the outer happenings out of the world of the coarse-substantial, the material, get
into your rationality, but instead you only store everything in your inadequate intellect which without rationa-
lity cannot separate and analyse the truthly facts, and as a result neither a clear perception, nor cognition, cog- nisance and no knowledge as well as no practical experience, no living-experience and no wisdom can come about.

### #565 (Chapter 28)

 Not only in the intellect, but also in the rationality, all things are called up for the collection, because only to -
 gether can intellect and rationality hold fast to something effectively and work it out to a result; but you are
 conceited and take everything apart and cut it into pieces with your inadequate intellect, and consequently it
 does not reach the rationality through which the possibility is first given that everything is really perceived,
 taken in, processed and made into the cognition and cognisance as well as into the knowledge, and into the
 practical experience and the living of it, and into the wisdom.

### #566 (Chapter 28)

 Know, just as your human consciousness, through its activity, sets everything free in a logical wise from the
 inside to the outside via the intellect and the rationality, so that it really does reach the outside, and indeed in
 whatever form, so everything from the outside can also only reach the consciousness again via the way of the
 intellect and the rationality and be processed by the consciousness as perception, cognition, cognisance,
 knowledge, practical experience, living experience and wisdom.

### #567 (Chapter 28)

 The impression of all outward happenings out of the material, i.e. the coarse-substantial must always reach the
 consciousness by coming from the outside via the intellect and the rationality, and indeed irrespective of which
 one of the sense-forms is taking something in.

### #568 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, there is no other way, because if the activity of the consciousness must go the exact same way in the
 opposite direction, i.e. towards the outside, then this too can only happen via the intellect and the rationality,
 because only together can intellect and rationality create a logical result; the intellect alone cannot create any
 result at all without the co-operation of the rationality, because the intellect alone leads in its activity to a rota-
 tion, to a rumination, i.e. to a going around in circles.

### #569 (Chapter 28)

 If you are ruminators, you crampfully hold fast to the impressions of the outer happening solely in your intel-
 lect and you take it apart and deconstruct it with your intellect, and in doing so you do not pass on anything
 or only a tiny part to your rationality, in which case the thought-activity distorts this tiny part with Gewaltsam-
 keit, which has the consequence that the realness, as it was, loses its reality.

### #570 (Chapter 28)

 This means that the rumination cannot bring about any progress nor any development, i.e. evolution of the consciousness which can only become real truth and reality through the entire process of the effective and
conscious perception, cognition and cognisance, knowledge, experience and the living of it, and wisdom.

### #571 (Chapter 28)

 Therefore it is recommended to you not to fall prey to the rumination, but instead to fully perceive, take in,
 process and live through everything in you, because only therethrough does everything consciously stream into
 your intellect and in your rationality and become a conscious and strong factor of the evolution and widen
 your real capability of understanding things, so also with regard to the creational laws and recommendations,
 the following of which is of greatest importance for your consciousness-based development and the becoming
 human in the real and true sense.

### #572 (Chapter 28)

 But truly, under the truth of these things you understand something that is wrong, because you only make
 demanding wishes to the life and you do not want to give anything to it in your conceit, through which you
 are no longer able to form anything in a healthy and correct wise, but only indulge in a belief in an invented
 god, tin god and in human beings whom you raise to the status of divinities and worship.

### #573 (Chapter 28)

 In your belief you hope for the kingdom of your god or that of a tin god or idolised human being, and even
 when just thinking about it, a joyful trembling goes through you, because you indeed hope for love, joy, a
 present and happiness from your worshipped ones, because the wrong and irrational teachings that are di-
 rected towards them present you the illusion of longing for their supposed help and goodness and an ability
 to restfully enjoy.

### #574 (Chapter 28)

 But owing to your deficient state of your intellect and your rationality, the majority of you earthly humankind
 are unable to comprehend that the wrong prophets and teachers as well as their priests and other represen-
 tatives dupe you, and with regard to the effective truth of all truth, and hence also in respect to the Creation
 and its laws and recommendations, cheat you and thus subjugate you into absolute belief-obedience.

### #575 (Chapter 28)

 Truly, the creational laws and recommendations do not demand of you that you must turn to the effective truth
 of all truth, they only recommend it, so you yourselves must decide over it and choose the right way; these
 laws and recommendations also do not demand and recommend that you shall sink into rumination and turn
 away from the truth, because on the contrary, the recommendations are such that you have to consider every-
 thing thoroughly, so that you may turn to the truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations and
 their following.

### #576 (Chapter 28)

 The recommendation of the Creation-given laws and recommendations is that you consciously in your own
 volition and in your completely free decision direct yourselves in your determinations, wishes and expectations
 totally towards the truth of all truth and the creational laws and recommendations.
 
### #577 (Chapter 28)

 Only if you follow the truth of all truth which is pre-given through the Creation and its laws and recommen-
 dations, will true love, freedom, harmony and true peace arise in you, because then everything disturbing,
 impeding and confusing falls away and is kept away.

### #578 (Chapter 28)

 You alone as human beings bring about everything, namely the good and the evil, the negative and positive,
 because you alone are responsible for all and everything, whatever you create in terms of thoughts and feel -
 ings as well as in terms of actions, deeds and all your activity.

### #579 (Chapter 28)

 You alone are the ones that bear the responsibility for the forming of your life, your life-conduct, your think-
 ing-directions and determinations, so you yourselves have to make an effort for a right guidance and forming
 of your existence.

### #580 (Chapter 28)

 You alone bear the responsibility for your behaviour in every respect, so you are also responsible for your state
 of the righteousness and unrighteousness, of the conscientiousness and consciencelessness, of the fairness and
 unfairness as well as of the dignity and deference and of the dignitilessness and deferencelessness.

### #581 (Chapter 28)

 Consider thereby that in every good, progressive and evolutionary respect, you cannot force anything and
 nothing is given to you for free, but that instead you must willingly and consciously work hard for everything
 yourselves, and truly the work in acquiring all of the good and high values is rich in deprivation, because with
 regard to the real truth of all truth, what is recommended for the acquiring work, is hard and inexorable.

### #582 (Chapter 28)

 But truly, the creating of all the high values of the life and the following of the creational laws and recommen-
 dations is also worthwhile, because the reward is true love, freedom, harmony and peace as well as virtuous-
 ness, conscientiousness, righteousness, fairness and being-fair in true dignity and deference.

### #583 (Chapter 28)

 Therewith, all you human beings of Earth, opens up the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, the teaching of the truth, the
 teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, and the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› as a comprehensive prophetic
 and true teaching book, that it may redound to the prosperousness of your consciousness-evolution and to
 your well-being of life, so that you do not continue to go forth in evolutionary consciousness-darkness and you
 no longer curse yourselves, but instead go towards the light of the truth of all truth and follow and fulfil the
 laws and recommendations of the Creation Universal Consciousness; and in this wise you shall do, so that true
 love, freedom, harmony and peace may come about in you yourselves and amongst your whole humankind
 and that you may free yourselves from your unrighteousness, consciencelessness, irresponsibility, unfairness,
 hatred, revenge and retaliation, murder, terror, war and from everything that is unfair, evil and ausgeartet
 which you have imposed upon yourselves as a curse since time immemorial.
