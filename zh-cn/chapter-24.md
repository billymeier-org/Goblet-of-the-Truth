Chapter 24
--------
{: .-three-column}


### #1 (Chapter 24)

 Human beings of Earth, when you listen to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
 of the life which is proclaimed to you in the ‹Goblet of the Truth› as the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› then your
 unknowledge about the effective truth falls and the truthly knowledge about the Creation and its all-embrac-
 ing laws and recommendations becomes the term of the truth in you which brings you liberation from all your
 hardship and from your misery, from all the unpeace, the wars, the disharmony, the hatred, the unfreedom
 and from all other terrible things through which you are enslaved.
 
### #2 (Chapter 24)

 But this only applies to those amongst you who look seriously for the truth in and outside yourselves by will-
 ingly enabling yourselves to do this and objectively analysing the objectiveness of the real truth.

### #3 (Chapter 24)

 If, however, you are religious, ideological or philosophical fanatics or reckless enthusiasts and are unable to
 liberate yourselves from this, then, during the course of your life, you will remain far from the truth which is
 given, on the one hand, in the creational laws and recommendations, whilst, on the other hand, it is formed
 in such a wise that you can only find it in yourselves by you fathoming it out in yourselves.

### #4 (Chapter 24)

 However, all those of you who are religious, ideological, philosophical fanatics or reckless enthusiasts, you live
 far from the truthly truth of the Creation-given, as a result of which you are damaging to the truth and de-
 ceive your fellow human beings to the untruth.

### #5 (Chapter 24)

 You, however, who have fallen prey to the untruth and the unknowledge, you are malicious ones and unob-
 jective ones against the truth, however you shall find your assessment in the words of the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life itself.

### #6 (Chapter 24)

 The ‹Goblet of the Truth› touches only those amongst you as a message who still bear a spark of truth in your-
 selves as well as the longing to know the actual truth of the life and to be a true, real human being; but, you
 others who have committed and bound yourselves to the religion and the belief in a god, in a tin god, demons,
 human beings or an ideology or philosophy and are their captives and slaves, you, as ever in the past, turn
 away from the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› because you are undiscerning and unteachable, and continue to
 vegetate away in your misery and in your hardship and want to have sorrow as your companion.

### #7 (Chapter 24)

 You, however, who are searching for the truth of all truth, the ‹Goblet of the Truth› will be a light for you and
 a rod upon which you can support yourselves, and you will be brought directly out of your inner chaos and
 out of your confusion through the teaching, so that you may finally live truthly.

### #8 (Chapter 24)

 The ‹Goblet of the Truth› does not bring you a new religion based on a god, tin god, demon, on a human
 being or devil, but rather the true ‹Teaching of the Prophets› is for you a torch in your darkness of the
 unknowledge and untruth so that you find the right way in the life and also take the way of the truth in your-
 selves which is itself the truth and the culmination point.

### #9 (Chapter 24)

 And if you take the way of the truth in yourselves, then you enter into the truth itself which has the way inher-
 ent in itself, by means of which you lead yourselves to your longed-for heights.

### #10 (Chapter 24)

 Always consider, human beings of Earth, that it is only when you move yourselves that you can come forwards
 in terms of consciousness, however if you attempt to help yourselves with external means then you let exter-
 nal authorities penetrate into you, as a result of which you are no longer yourselves and you totter forwards
 as if on crutches and no longer know how to use your own limbs.

### #11 (Chapter 24)

 If, however, you move yourselves and solely in your consciousness and you do not use ready-made views of
 external means of help and you do not make use of such means either, then you are free and you can have
 free rein to do rightfully and to take the way of the truth.

### #12 (Chapter 24)

 Therefore, move yourselves in yourselves and acquire all the capabilities that you need for the learning and for
 the living.

### #13 (Chapter 24)

 Listen to the call of the truth in yourselves and do not await the effort of the fathoming out of the truth to be
 taken away from you from outside, because if you await it then you are slumbering senselessly away and you
 will not find the requisites in yourselves which you must use for the rise up to the truthly truth.

### #14 (Chapter 24)

 If you, however, use the help that is given to you through the creational laws and recommendations according
 to your own will, then you will overcome all hindrances which misguidingly want to cross your way, the way
 that you have to take in yourselves when fathoming out the truth.

### #15 (Chapter 24)

 Human beings of Earth, finally awake out of your lethargy and reach the truthly knowledge of the creational
 truth through your conscious endeavours.

### #16 (Chapter 24)

 Only if you find the real truth in yourselves and you turn to the laws and recommendations of the Creation
 and also follow them, will you find the way out of your misery, out of your hardship and out of all your terri-
 ble things into the reality of the truthly life.

### #17 (Chapter 24)

 Know that the right knowledge is only given in the real truth, and this becomes the all-embracing term of the
 wisdom.

### #18 (Chapter 24)

 And consider that alone the knowledge and the actual term about the truth could solve all your problems which have burdened you for thousands of years and threaten to lead you into the ultimate catastrophe.

### #19 (Chapter 24)

 However, be certain that finding the truthly truth of all truth in yourselves means that you must examine,
 fathom and recognise everything down to the last detail, ruthless against all untruth and all unknowledge, so
 that you stand in true vitality in the light of the truth of the all-embracing Creation.
