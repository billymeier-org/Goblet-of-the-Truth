Chapter 25
--------
{: .-three-column}


### #1 (Chapter 25)

 You whole humankind of Earth, you are since time immemorial searching for the truth, but in doing so you do
 not know what you are actually searching for so busily, because you do not know the real truth.

### #2 (Chapter 25)

 Your search for the truth goes through the world like a huge roaring and echoes on all ends of the earth, but
 you find not that which you are really searching for, as over and over again you become entangled in some
 religious, ideological or philosophical belief or other and pray to a god, tin god or human being, through which
 you move further and further away from the truth that exists only in the Creation and in its laws and recom-
 mendations and that you must fathom and recognise in yourselves, if you strive towards this uprightly in a neutral
 wise and thereby without any connection to a belief, god, tin god or human being.

### #3 (Chapter 25)

 You whole humankind of Earth, you are being guided into the unreal through false prophets and teachers with false teachings, to one god or to several, to tin gods and to human beings that you shall worship and beseech.

### #4 (Chapter 25)

 And you are flooded with a gigantic torrent of religious, esoteric, philosophical, ideological and sectarian books
 and writings, and also with radio and television programmes, and with websites in the internet, as well as with
 proselytisations of every other kind, to make you captured believers of a religion, sect, ideology or philosophy
 or to bind you yet more strictly to them, that you become not secessionists and that you turn not to the truthly
 truth of all truth.

### #5 (Chapter 25)

 Amongst all peoples, the schooled academics dig into old books and writings of all kinds, try to research them
 and ruminate thereon until their consciousness is exhausted and confused.

### #6 (Chapter 25)

 And there appear amongst your entire humankind of Earth ever more false prophets and teachers with false
 teachings, who lead you further into the unreal and far from the truth, as has happened since time immemorial;
 they call themselves prophets, leaders, masters and sublime ones, and also substitutes and representatives of
 a god or tin god, and drive you with false warnings, promises, hopes and predictions into anxiety and dread;
 and truly, they try everything to make you subservient to their belief, in which case a considerable number of
 them not only guide you into the unreal but also exploit and abuse you in terms of your goods and chattels,
 your riches, and more than a few of you also sexually.

### #7 (Chapter 25)

 And the new time brings with it that you humankind of Earth let yourselves be deceived by all sides of the false
 prophets and false teachings by all the irresponsible ones that attack you like a swarm of poisonous insects
 and suddenly, in the fever of their delusion for wellbeing, want to bring over you a new light of the belief and
 godly redemption.

### #8 (Chapter 25)

 As never before in all of time, new sects of all kinds are springing up like poisonous mushrooms out of your society and are rummaging through your mental-block, your consciousness and your thoughts and feelings as
well as your psyche with their belief of wellbeing, and this truly in a kind and wise that is neither refreshing
nor quickening, but that on the contrary causes terribleness in you, sears you through the fire of the deluded
belief and suckles and takes from your last energy and power, and also from your weak rationality and your
inadequate intellect that still have remained to you in your demolished gloominess of your present life, in a
present in which through your irrationality and selfishness you strive to destroy the world, its nature as well as
the life through your rampant overpopulation which out of sheer egoism you do not want to get under control.

### #9 (Chapter 25)

 Stirring in you in a religious-belief-based whispering and murmuring wise, is the hope of a growing expectation
 that help is approaching that will release you from all terrible things, which is why you are uncalm and full of
 expectation in your longing; you however let yourselves be talked into this false hope and this false expectation
 through false prophets, false teachers, gurus, masters, sublime ones and others that exploit you and guide you
 into the unreal, so that you become fanatical and incapable of recognising and realising even one iota of the
 real truth; so you vegetate away in irrational belief in godheads, tin gods, demons and human beings who raise
 themselves up above you religiously, ideologically or philosophically in order to abuse you in many wises and
 even to drive you to commit suicide en masse.

### #10 (Chapter 25)

 You whole humankind of Earth, it undulates and surges in you through your religious, sectarian, ideological
 and philosophical belief-forms, and truly there lies upon you in a gloomily brooding wise a stupefaction of
 fanatic belief and just as fanatic devotion and submissiveness, that you do everything, even murder human
 lives, to fight for your belief.

### #11 (Chapter 25)

 The whole scenario of your belief of any kind is pregnant from terribleness, out of which only evil and
 Ausartung can spring forth and be born.

### #12 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you whole humankind of Earth, you live in a belief-based confusion filled with pusillanimousness and
 ruin; and if you do not finally tear up powerfully the dark coating around your belief, which enwraps also you
 yourselves, then you will have a very evil future.

### #13 (Chapter 25)

 The dark coating around your belief is like a sticky and stringy, dirty and swampy mass that absorbs and chokes
 every free thought of light that comes to you before it can even begin to act to the smallest degree and be -
 come strong.
 
### #14 (Chapter 25)

 The swampy mass of your belief in gods, tin gods, demons as well as in angels and saints and in a devil chokes
 the truth in you and brings forth a weird silence there, because you have sunk into a belief-swamp and not
 even one healthy thought to the truth-finding can grow up in you, because an impulse for this is already nipped
 in the bud and decays and destroys everything before even one iota of a recognition of the truth can come
 about.

### #15 (Chapter 25)

 You however who are blatantly searching for the light of the real truth, all energy and power is no use to you
 if you do not get rid of and drain the swamp of the unknowledge and the untruth in yourselves, and if you
 think that through shouting and big words you will find the true light of the truth; your loud shouts and big
 words become fainter and fainter and go unheard as if in a desolate wasteland amongst all impostors, gurus,
 masters, godly ones, sublime ones, false prophets and worshippers and servants of the gods, tin gods, demons,
 angels, saints and of the evil, which you call the devil, as all of these whom you believe help you are leading
 you away from the real truth and into the unreal.

### #16 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, they do not feed you with the bread of the truth of all truth, with the creational laws and recommenda- tions and with all the love, knowledge and wisdom contained therein, but rather they offer you stones of the
unknowledge and the untruth as nourishment, so that you break your teeth thereon and lead a painful life.

### #17 (Chapter 25)

 All of them, those who deceive you to the untruth and to the unknowledge, they offer you countless books,
 writings and teachings that are full of falsehood and guidance into the unreal and that stupefy and tire out
 your human consciousness instead of it beginning to live.

### #18 (Chapter 25)

 And if you consider this truth, by finding it in yourselves, recognising it and working it out, then you will find
 in yourselves the proof of the unfruitfulness of all the false and irrational teachings that are ingratiatingly pre-
 sented to you through all those irresponsible ones who raise themselves up above you as masters, gurus, teach-
 ers, sublime ones, godly ones, priests, representatives of gods and substitutes of gods or as self-raised glorifi-
 cations and let themselves be adored and worshipped by you.

### #19 (Chapter 25)

 Consider that such ones ingratiating themselves with you are deceivers and slanderers of the truth of the Creation itself as well as of its laws and recommendations, and through their untruths, through their unknowl-
edge and through their senselessnesses they tire out your consciousness, but this is truly never of rightness.

### #20 (Chapter 25)

 It is not cheating on the truth that stills the hunger of your consciousness for knowledge and wisdom, but
 rather the bread of the truth, as the truth alone refreshes and quickens you, and the light of the truth warms
 you and gives you life.

### #21 (Chapter 25)

 It is understandable if many of you human beings of Earth are almost faint-hearted when you see and experi-
 ence how abominably the real truth is treated and that through your religions, ideologies and philosophies, as
 well as through the esoterism, the sectarianism and the so-called spiritual science walls are built up around the
 truth so that it is not open to you and you stumble in truth-unknowing confusion.

### #22 (Chapter 25)

 And everything that they offer you in terms of all the irrational, confusing, wrong and far-from-the-truth teach-
 ings, you cannot really understand, because they are written in strange expressions and words as well as in
 academic sentences, with which you give yourselves airs and boast if you can name them, but in reality you
 understand them every bit as little as those who write, teach and spread the whole drivel of the wrong teach-
 ings.

### #23 (Chapter 25)

 The true spiritual science consists however in the ‹teaching of the spirit›, i.e. in the ‹spiritual teaching›, and this
 is not complicated and is to be understood and comprehended by each of you human beings – provided of
 course that you bear intellect and rationality and are not captured in a confused belief.

### #24 (Chapter 25)

 You speak always of your imaginary god or tin gods, of your angels and saints as well as of your gurus, masters,
 sublime ones and self-appointed divinities etc., and assume that universities shall be established for these
 senselessnesses – if indeed in certain cases you have not already done so –, in order to be able to obtain the
 ability in yourselves to recognise and to comprehend the term god, tin god, angel or saint etc.; but truly, your
 pathological craving concerning this is merely connected with an irrational and confusing belief, as it is also to
 a great extent in your wrong ambition that is rooted in your wanting to shine before your fellow human beings
 and to be heard by your god or tin god, angel or saints, and to appear great before them.

### #25 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, you believers in a godhead, in a tin god or a demon, in angels and saints, in gurus, masters, sublime
 ones, emissaries of gods and self-appointed gods or representatives of gods, you are tumbling like drunkards
 through your life and from one belief-delusion to another, and in doing so you are one-sided, unfree and unsure
 in yourselves, because you have been led astray from the simple way of the truth, on the one hand through
 the blame of all those who deceive you to the untruth and to belief, and on the other hand through your own
 guilt, because you only want to think about a belief rather than turn consciously to the truth, because you
 eschew the bearing of the responsibility that is connected with the real truth of all truth.
 
### #26 (Chapter 25)

 But cease to be faint-hearted ones through your belief, which leads you ever further from the creational truth
 and lets you find neither the true love and harmony nor the peace and freedom in yourselves and in your whole
 humankind.

### #27 (Chapter 25)

 Learn to be serious searchers for the truth that you can find only in the creational laws and recommendations
 as well as in yourselves on the way of the truth, which is itself the truth and the culmination-point; this way
 of the truth as truth itself, lies in each of you, you humankind of Earth.

### #28 (Chapter 25)

 But truly, be conscious that the way of the truth in you, which itself is the truth and the culmination-point,
 cannot be taken through academic learning and not through a religious, sectarian, ideological or philosophical
 belief.

### #29 (Chapter 25)

 Choose solely and exclusively the way of the truth in you, the way that is in itself the way, truth and culmina-
 tion-point, because only the real truth is the great example on the true way of the light.

### #30 (Chapter 25)

 The truth itself is pure and simple, without cult-activities and rites, as well as without beseeching prayers to a
 god or tin god or human being, and by the truth you do not have to fight against erroneous assumptions and
 falsehoods, consequently you do not have to tread the way of the truth arduously through belief-rules and
 belief-dogmas as well as through cult-activities, rites, beseeching prayers and through submissiveness, etc.; if
 however you are taught otherwise through false teachers and false prophets etc., then these teachings are the
 greatest enemies of you human beings, because they are bare cheatings, lies and calumnies against the effect-
 ive truth.

### #31 (Chapter 25)

 So back away from all the false teachings and false prophets and also from all the other preachers of false-
 hoods and teachers of the irrational truth-teachings who characterlessly misuse everything venerable in you
 and guide you far from all truth into the unreal, through which you fall into lovelessness, affliction and misery
 in yourselves, so also into hatred, unpeace, disharmony, unfreedom and the pathological craving for revenge,
 which leads to the fact that through wars, revolts and through torture and the death penalty you bring many
 deaths and destructions over your whole humankind.

### #32 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you humankind of Earth, you are fully seized by all the evil, which you however do not want to be true
 and vehemently deny, because you yourselves are not even conscious of this fact, because you are captured in
 you by the irrational teachings of the false prophets and teachers, which as the work of human brains are
 patchworks of the evil and the untruth and remain such a patchwork, however deeply your belief therein may
 be anchored.

### #33 (Chapter 25)

 Consider that your belief in a godhead or in a tin god, in angels and saints, gurus, masters, sublime ones or
 representatives of gods etc. will never lead to the creational truth, to the Creation itself and its laws and recom-
 mendations, which are also given in the nature, in all life and in all existence.

### #34 (Chapter 25)

 You shall recognise the truthly truth in yourselves, as well as in the recommendations and the laws of the
 Creation, so you create knowledge thereout in yourselves and turn this knowledge into wisdom, since only
 through real knowledge and through its essence, the wisdom, can you fully understand the effective truth of
 all truth.

### #35 (Chapter 25)

 Through your truth-unknowledge, however, the comprehension-capability of your consciousness is narrowly
 restricted, because this is firmly bound to space and time, so it is already no longer capable of really realising
 the eternity and the endless assigned to the Creation, even if the terms can be expressed mathematically.

### #36 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you humankind of Earth, your consciousness with its intellect and its rationality stands before the uncom-
 prehensible energy and power of the Creation and its laws and recommendations, which streams through
 everything existing, whereas the energy and power of the Creation lives and works from out of itself.

### #37 (Chapter 25)

 And you human beings receive the energy and power of the Creation and its laws and recommendations at
 every moment of your lives as implicitness, without you making even a tiny iota of thoughts about it; and were
 you to do so, then despite your intellect you could still not realise what the creational energy and power in
 reality are.

### #38 (Chapter 25)

 Your consciousness and your thereout resulting rationality and your intellect offer only an inadequate activity,
 wherethrough naturally your consciousness-works are also subject to a restriction, which is the rationality, the
 intellect as well as the thoughts and feelings; and out of this very reason alone, your learning, you humankind
 of Earth, with regard to the effective recognition of the real truth of all truth, remains left to your intellect and
 your rationality alone, through which you must perceive and recognise the truth and take it into cognisance in
 order to work it out as knowledge, experience it and then live it, out of which only then the essence evolves,
 the wisdom, which is relatively complete truth; relative, because the real truth of all truth always and endlessly
 leads to new perceptions, cognitions and cognisances, to expanded knowledge and the experience thereof,
 and to the living of what is experienced, and then to flow again into the essence, i.e. into the wisdom, and
 thus into the effective relative truth, which is again the cause for new things, i.e. new effects to continuously
 come forth out of it as wisdom, i.e. truth.
 
### #39 (Chapter 25)

 Your learning is – due to your school-knowledge and your hanging on to religions, sects, ideologies and
 philosophies, false teachings and teachers as well as false prophets and belief-forms – directed towards think-
 ing about details, but not the whole of a thing, despite the fact that you as human beings all together carry
 that uncomprehensible whole in yourselves, through which you are fully capable of reaching the highest and
 most noble in yourselves through the learning of the real creational truth, which is possible for you through
 your intellect and through your rationality; rather than this, however, you show contempt for this creational
 gift, and instead of the truth, you follow your belief in a god or tin god, in angels, saints and demons, in a
 devil or in human beings who raise themselves above you and whom you idolise and worship.

### #40 (Chapter 25)

 Free yourselves from all this, for this is only an evil torture practised upon you not only by the false teachings
 and teachers and by the false prophets but also through you yourselves, because you are submissively depen-
 dent on the irrational teachings.

### #41 (Chapter 25)

 Consider that there are no great masters, gurus, sublime ones, emissaries of gods and the like, as well as no
 fantasised god, tin god or devil etc. who can command you against your own will, that you must follow the
 nonsense of their irrational teachings, because to you alone is given the power, the intellect, the rationality and
 the decisional Gewalt to determine over yourselves, as well as over what you want to do or not do, and whether
 you want to fall prey to a belief or to turn to the effective truth of the Creation and its laws and recommen-
 dations.

### #42 (Chapter 25)

 If you humankind of Earth are yourselves and do not let yourselves be steered through religions, sects, ideologies,
 philosophies and their false teachings, then you will be able to build up in yourselves a solid volition to the
 good and to the real truth of all truth, so that you can give your thoughts and feelings as well as your deeds
 and your activity love and purity as well as harmony, peace and freedom; and if you can do that, then you have
 already found the way of the truth in yourselves, which is in itself the truth and the culmination-point.

### #43 (Chapter 25)

 And to do this, you need neither religions nor ideologies or philosophies, neither do you need their irrational,
 confusing and false teachings in books, writings, pictures and words; and thus you do not need to dedicate
 yourselves to hermitage or isolation or to asceticism in order to find the truth in yourselves, to realise it and
 then to live according to it, nor does this require a special consciousness-based effort, through which you could
 be overstrained; truthly it requires only your normal consciousness-power as well as your good and clear intel-
 lect and the equally good and clear rationality, motivation and a solid will to carry out everything and to bring
 it to the end.

### #44 (Chapter 25)

 And if you humankind of Earth act in this wise, then you will be healthy in your mental-block and in the con-
 sciousness-block, therefore in your consciousness itself as well as in your thoughts and feelings, in your psyche
 as well as in your personality and in your character.

### #45 (Chapter 25)

 Thus if you act wisely in this regard, you free yourselves from all the pressure of a morbid search and rumina-
 tion concerning the truth-search, so you become human beings who do not succumb to the false of a religious,
 ideological or philosophical belief like an orchid that can wilt at the merest touch of a cool breeze.

### #46 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, your consciousness is the foundation stone and the tool of all your thoughts and feel-
 ings as well as of your deeds and activities, but this consciousness is in its activity still inadequate, through
 which restrictions are naturally imposed on you, which you must open through your own intellect and through
 your rationality, so that you open the blockades in your consciousness and become more broad-sighted and
 also comprehend all those things that go beyond the material and stir in the realm of the spiritual and the
 consciousness-based, and belong in the realm of the creational laws and recommendations.

### #47 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, wake up and look around in yourselves, so that you hear your own voice in yourselves
 which calls for the effective truth and for the fulfilment of the creational laws and recommendations; and only
 if you do this shall the way of the truth open itself in you, which has the truth and the culmination-point inher-
 ent in itself.

### #48 (Chapter 25)

 Be yourselves and pay no attention to the strife in the world, nor to the strife of the religions, ideologies and philosophies, nor to the false teachers with their false teachings, and also not to the false prophets and to your
false, imaginary gods, tin gods, demons, angels and saints, and to all those that pass themselves off to you as
truth-bringers, such as gurus, sect-leaders, masters, sublime ones and however else they all call themselves.

### #49 (Chapter 25)

 The only truthly truth-bringer are you yourselves, if you fathom and recognise the truthly truth in yourselves
 and in the creational laws and recommendations; and the true prophets, who bring you the ‹Goblet of the
 Truth›, the ‹Teachings of the Prophets›, i.e. the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
 of the life, they tell you merely what you shall look at and what you shall do in order to find the truth in your-
 selves and in the laws and recommendations of the Creation; the true prophets only teach you in the mode in
 the truth, so that you may find it in yourselves, just as they also only teach you in the causal connections of all
 things; however, they do not teach you to follow their words and their teaching submissively, but that you
 yourselves decide in yourselves for learning and fathom everything in yourselves, find the effective truth and
 follow it.
 
### #50 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore do not let yourselves be deceived by connecting yourselves to a religion, ideology or philosophy, rather
 be yourselves in every wise and search for the truthly truth only there, where it is actually to be found, namely
 in yourselves and in the laws and recommendations of the Creation.

### #51 (Chapter 25)

 Consider that there is no physical manifestation of a godly love, but only the true love, which proceeds from
 out of the Creation itself through the effects of the laws and recommendations which as fundamental sub-
 stance is in your deepest, spiritual nature, through which you too are capable of the true love out of a fine-
 spiritual perception as well as the feeling-based love.

### #52 (Chapter 25)

 Do not attach yourselves to any confessions, ideologies or philosophies but rather create an own and healthy
 life-view, based on the truthly truth that you find in yourselves, so that you are free in your human conscious-
 ness, which may not be enslaved through religious, ideological or philosophical dogmas or through a godly
 spark invented by you human beings, which has no energy or power.

### #53 (Chapter 25)

 Dogmas and other compulsory tenets are and remain human inventions and are never words or the work of the Creation, but are the work of human beings in order to constrain your human sense and to press it into
forms of the depravity, which however means a systematic degrading and distorting of the creational in you.

### #54 (Chapter 25)

 Truly you should recoil from dogmas and other compulsory tenets and irrational teachings, through which you
 can never experience the great reality of the creational truth, but through which your search for the truth be-
 comes ever more hopeless, which drives you slowly but surely into the despair.

### #55 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, finally wake up and become yourselves, bring forth in yourselves your own decisions and be therefore free in your thoughts and feelings, so that you shatter all dogmatic walls in you and pull down
the bandage of the belief in gods, demons, angels, sublime ones, tin gods and human idols which makes you
unseeing, so that you finally become seeing and can perceive the light of the truth in an unmutilated wise.

### #56 (Chapter 25)

 And if you do this, you will rejoice in yourselves and swing your consciousness through the cognition of the
 truth into the heights, to find the true love in the Creation and in its completion that is the highest possible
 for you, which your intellect does not know, because of the captivity of your belief with regard to religions,
 ideologies, philosophies and their irrational teachings.

### #57 (Chapter 25)

 You must recognise, you humankind of Earth, that you, in form of your spirit-form in you, are a minute part
 of the all-embracing Creation, which is why you shall unify yourselves with it through your consciousness,
 namely by turning to the truth of all truth and as a result give enough consideration to your consciousness-
 evolution; free yourselves with your whole energy and power from your truth-unknowledgeness and give your-
 selves the gift of the truth-recognition and truth-following, through which you find your way out of the chaos
 and rise up to the higher in yourselves, which makes you joyful of your life, fills you with true love and creates
 peace, freedom and harmony in you and amongst your whole humankind.

### #58 (Chapter 25)

 But you humankind of Earth, you are still not ready to really turn to the truth, because if you are looked at and
 considered more closely, then you are still far away from extending your hand to the truth and therefore also
 to the creational laws and recommendations.

### #59 (Chapter 25)

 You are still very far from the creational truth, although many amongst you are searching particularly vigour-
 ously for the truth, but unfortunately you do this in a wrong wise, because truthly you are not searching for
 the truth itself, but rather for leaders and helpers; leaders and helpers, to whom you want to give belief regard -
 ing their false teachings and through which you feel yourselves as raised in your thoughts and feelings as also
 in regard to being able to subordinate yourselves suppliantly to a leader, guru, master, sublime one or godly one,
 etc., merely because you nourish the wrong opinion that you are already thoroughly prepared for recognising
 the supposed truth-bringer, hearing his or her words and understanding his or her teaching.

### #60 (Chapter 25)

 What you are nourishing and cherishing in this regard, however, are no more and no less than many splittings
 (different forms of opinions, views, meanings etc.), by which you are ruled in yourselves and which will never
 let you find the truth.

### #61 (Chapter 25)

 The ‹Goblet of the Truth›, the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, i.e. the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
 the teaching of the life affect you in a peculiar wise, because it is anything but a teaching with religious, ideo-
 logical or philosophical empty phrases, and because you are entangled and captured in such empty phrases
 and are submissively dependent on them, you create in yourselves a false picture of the real truth, and estab -
 lish causes to bask in overbearingness and wrong self-evaluation and to go the wrong way that is based in a
 religious, ideological or philosophical belief.

### #62 (Chapter 25)

 Instead of a true deference towards the Creation, there has come about in you, you humankind of Earth, a
 whimpering begging and beseeching to a god, demons, devil or tin gods, to angels, sublime ones or human
 idols; and thereby you have become Wesen who always only want to receive, but never ever want to contrib-
 ute anything yourselves at any price, just as it is also not pleasing for you to bear the responsibility.

### #63 (Chapter 25)

 You pray and beseech, which you can do very well, but that it is demanded of you yourselves that you shall
 do something and do a lot of work for what you demand and on yourselves, you want to know nothing of
 this, because it is uncomfortable for you and would require you to think according to the truth.
 
### #64 (Chapter 25)

 Nonetheless, however, you have the audacity in the imperious belief in yourselves to be autonomous, indepen-
 dent and so full of power to be able to do and not do everything yourselves, as you want, and thus cultivate
 the delusion of being equal to the Creation.

### #65 (Chapter 25)

 Very many amongst you, you humankind of Earth, you merely await and claim and believe that it is not you
 who must bow to the creational laws and recommendations but that it is they that must bow to you; truly,
 wherever you look, you see only your doubtfulness, because on the one hand you live in an ausgeartet over-
 bearingness against everything creational, and on the other hand you sink down in blatant submissiveness and
 cowardice before your invented gods, tin gods, angels and saints or before your human idols.

### #66 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you are missing the right self-evaluation and modesty as well as the true love and the feelings for your-
 selves as well as for your fellow human beings, and if you nonetheless want to search for and find the truth
 in yourselves and around yourselves as well as in the creational laws and recommendations, then it is in the
 first place necessary that you descend from your artificial height that you have created for yourselves, because
 this is the first step you must take if you really and truly want to become a human being.

### #67 (Chapter 25)

 You are like a bloated pufferfish that senses danger and thus blows itself up, so likewise you blow yourselves
 up and boast with your religious, ideological or philosophical truth-unknowledge and its irrational teachings,
 because you fear the creational truth of all truth; but consider, how the pufferfish can in an unheedful moment
 find itself trapped between the fangs of its enemy and lose its life, so will it also go with you if you are cast
 into ruin through your belief; and if that happens, you will have no more time to lose to liberate yourselves
 from out of your hardship and out of your misery.

### #68 (Chapter 25)

 Do not therefore think that, with regard to the truth-finding, it can go on endlessly in this wise of the idleness,
 as it has been the case already for millennia, because sooner or later the time comes when you must turn to
 the true creational truth of all truth and connect yourselves with it.

### #69 (Chapter 25)

 Do not therefore wait for any leader or helper from whom you expect and indeed demand in a miserable wise
 that they shall show you and prepare a way up to the light of the truth, because truthly it is only you alone
 who must strive for the truth and strike and tread your own way.

### #70 (Chapter 25)

 You must yourselves make everything comprehensible in such a wise that you can understand and logically fol-
 low it by choosing the right way, so that you find both the truth and yourselves in your inner nature.

### #71 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore, search for and find the truth in your own intellect and in the rationality and let the false leaders and
 helpers be what they are, because it is not they who can bring you the truth, but you alone, because you alone
 must bear the efforts, even if you believe that these efforts would be taken away through the false teachers,
 leaders and helpers.

### #72 (Chapter 25)

 Only if you call yourselves to the truth can you find the right way and the truth of all truth in you and in the
 creational laws and recommendations, but this requires you to strive for it yourselves and not follow false
 teachers, leaders and helpers.

### #73 (Chapter 25)

 It is your task to find the real truth as such yourselves and to become knowing therein, not, however, to fall
 prey to a false conviction through false teachers and teachings as well as leaders and helpers.

### #74 (Chapter 25)

 You however, you who are many, you believe that you yourselves do not firstly need to strive to find the effec-
 tive truth, because these efforts would be done for you by any teachers, leaders, helpers or prophets, truly, you
 are foolish and do not find the way of the truth in yourselves, which is itself the truth and the culmination-
 point, which is why you remain unknowing and suffer misery and hardship, are full of jealousy and hatred and
 indulge in pathological craving for revenge, in retaliation and wars, as well as in crime, calumny, lies and decep-
 tion, and also in strife and destruction.

### #75 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you yourselves must awaken, because all the false teachers, leaders, prophets and helpers with their false
 teachings cannot awaken you out of your sleep of the truth-unknowledgeness, and you must also go the way
 of the rightful, the responsibility and the conscientiousness alone, because only you alone can do all this for
 yourselves.

### #76 (Chapter 25)

 Consider the true word, that you as true human beings are still not so valueful, as you imagine and believe
 this, that you would be equal to the Creation, but if you want to be trustworthy, then you must turn to the
 creational laws and recommendations, learn out of them and fulfil them, because only thus can you become
 what you want to be.

### #77 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you search for the truth of the life, however, you are searching for something that
 you do not yet understand, because you are captured in the belief in godheads and tin gods and human idols
 and assume that this is the truth, but the effective truth is not based on a belief but in truthly knowledge and
 the thereout resulting, unfallible wisdom and deep-reaching love.

### #78 (Chapter 25)

 And as you do not understand the truth, so you also do not understand the life and vegetate away in confu-
 sion, wherethrough, despite the progress you make in many areas, you remain far from the creational truth of
 all truth and no longer know what you actually want; but be certain that sooner or later you will and must
 experience in yourselves what really shall be.
 
### #79 (Chapter 25)

 You are a peculiar sort of human beings, because although you search for the truth that you do not yet under-
 stand, you criticise, insult and slander it, because you believe in godheads, tin gods and human idols – how
 can you as human beings think and act so irrationally, since, after all, you possess the capability of the intel-
 lect and the rationality?

### #80 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, consider that you cannot keep on acting and living in this wise endlessly, because the
 truth and the life make no concessions, but rather demand their right in all things of the existence; but since
 you act contrary to this with all the irrationality available to you, you tread yourselves and in so doing you cause
 yourselves pain, misery and hardship, from which you can free yourselves only if you cast aside and reject every-
 thing which is contrary to the truth, and is therefore unrightful and of the unright, as well as of the irrespon-
 sibility and consciencelessness.

### #81 (Chapter 25)

 Those however amongst you, you humankind of Earth, who – thinking in intellect and rationality – are seri-
 ously searching for the real truth of all truth, for the truth of the life, the truth of the Creation and its laws and
 recommendations, you are able to recognise that the best that the whole humankind needs lies precisely in
 the fair, responsible and conscientious, attentive, strict and heedful thoughts and feelings, because the whole
 humankind is enmeshed very deeply in its consciousness-indolence.

### #82 (Chapter 25)

 And just with this, that the intellectual understanding concerning the words of the truth demands right from
 the beginning a consciousness-based activity, so however also a striving and a serious volition, is the possibility
 given that already at the beginning of the consciousness-activity and thus the thought-activity, the chaff can
 easily be separated from the grain and therefore the truth can be understood; therein lies an autonomous
 activity, as laid down through the creational laws and as you human beings also fundamentally want it.

### #83 (Chapter 25)

 Those however amongst you, you humankind of Earth, who are that sort of human beings and think yourselves
 to be particularly active, you design a grotesque picture of teachers, leaders, helpers and prophets who are
 supposed to help you find the way of the truth and the truth itself; you are however extremely foolish, because
 you expect them to be really wise and knowing and consciousness-acrobats who can do miracles for you.

### #84 (Chapter 25)

 You however let yourselves be deceived even deeper into the untruth, because they know only the untruth and
 not the truth itself, and furthermore you presume that they are clairvoyants and clairaudients, telepaths and
 channelers, but truthly they understand nothing of this; and you also believe that they are emissaries of god
 or truth-knowers and great ‹spirits›, what in reality they are however not.

### #85 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, if they were really capable of using the consciousness-powers and of controlling the pineal gland, in
 order to be able to be active in the realm of fine-fluidal swinging waves, even then they would not be able to
 rise above the ban of the material, since these things also stir only in the lower boundaries of the material and
 can lay no claim to the purely spiritual, consequently they are rather worthless for the purposes of finding the
 truth of all truth, since they are no more, no less than only aspects of the consciousness-capabilities that can
 be used, if the way thereto is found and taken.

### #86 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you cannot be helped towards a general rise up to the truth and to the conscious-
 ness-evolution by showing you things and effects of the consciousness-powers that you can see, hear or feel,
 because this has nothing to do with a real rise up to the truth and to the consciousness-evolution, as it also
 does not serve any purpose for your material progress; things and effects that are brought about out of the
 consciousness-powers are no more, no less than signs of the powers of the consciousness, nothing more than
 that, and are interesting only for entertainment, carrying out work or for obtaining information etc.; for the
 evolution of the consciousness and using its powers, as well as fathoming out and following the effective truth
 that you find in yourselves and in the creational laws and recommendations, does not require any demonstra-
 tion of the things and effects of the consciousness-powers.

### #87 (Chapter 25)

 That you, however, wish for yourselves teachers, helpers, gurus, clerics as well as sublime ones and the like,
 who present you consciousness-powers as miraculous signs and proof of the rightness of their belief in a god-
 head, a tin god or demons, this is already founded in blatant ridiculousness, and even then, if you take their
 activities in this wise bitter seriously – if those worshipped and beseeched by you are even capable of bringing
 forth such signs of the consciousness-powers.

### #88 (Chapter 25)

 And you are of the irrational opinion that a true teacher and proclaimer of the truth is of godly nature, but this also corresponds to an irrational belief, such as the belief in a godhead, because a true proclaimer and teacher
of the truth is a human being out of your midst and is as integrated into all the heights and depths of the life
as you yourselves, so therefore also into illness, health, accident as well as fortune and unfortune; so they are
not spared from these things, even if you think wrongly that such things cannot happen to a truthly teacher
and proclaimer because he or she is under god's protection; truly, you do not consider that every godhead is
an insubstantiality invented through you human beings yourselves and is completely without energy and
power, whereas true proclaimers and teachers are simple human beings and thus integrated into the course of
fortune and unfortune and illness and health of the life; and since true prophets and teachers are in flesh,
blood and consciousness human beings and therefore people of your kind, it is erroneous to assume that they
 were raised above unfortune and illness or even above departing out of the life, because fundamentally every-
 thing existent is integrated into these things and into the becoming and passing; if however you think that this
 does not meet the fact, then you make yourselves a wrong opinion which sinks into complete ridiculousness. 
### #89 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, it is quite true that you humankind of Earth shall help yourselves, which also refers to illness and
 unfortune, so you can bring under control illnesses and pains that simply belong in one wise or another to the
 material body, depending on how the bodily state of health is formed, but you cannot one-sidedly through the
 Gewalt of the consciousness-powers make the body permanently insensible to internal and external influences,
 as this is also by no means possible by an outstanding ‹great spirit›; truly, the body can one-sidedly be made
 temporarily insensible, e.g. through hypnosis and meditation, but anyone who is able to do this is nonetheless
 no outstanding great one, because the whole doing is merely based on the control of one’s own conscious-
 ness-powers, not however on the use of any godly powers, which do not exist.

### #90 (Chapter 25)

 If however you believe in godly miraculous powers, which are purely illusory, if some amongst you can show
 signs through their consciousness-powers that you understand neither as to their source nor to their effects
 and in the final effect itself, and therefore believe that these are godly miraculous powers that bring forth
 everything, then you are human beings who stand there with shining eyes and open mouth, wishing you could
 do the same.

### #91 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore there are many amongst you who are in the present time still miracle-believers as well as ‹spirit›- and
 god-searchers, and who cling to the untruth of a religious, demonic, ideological or philosophical belief, through
 which however you realise no gain of the truth, but wander about in a dark vault of the truth-unknowledge,
 which you yourselves have created.

### #92 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, in your unknowledge about the truth you are like consciousness-based clowns who are drunk from the
 belief and balance dangerously on a high-strung tightrope, in danger of falling at any time, but you do not
 recognise to where your doing will finally lead you.

### #93 (Chapter 25)

 If you look at and consider your search for the true of the truth, then you will experience that you do not know
 where you are actually going and what you want to strive for; and you are living in the delusion that you can-
 not live alone but rather only under the protection of a god, tin god or idolised human being, a leader, helper,
 master, guru or sublime one and god-equivalent, etc., who must be great enough that through his or her con-
 sciousness, which you wrongly call ‹spirit›, he or she can rule his or her body and his or her life to such an
 extent that he or she no longer knows any illness or hardship, as has been handed down to you slanderously
 since time immemorial through stories of lies about true prophets.

### #94 (Chapter 25)

 And consider, only the spirit itself cannot be afflicted by illness, unfortune and hardship of any kind, because
 it alone is of purest creational nature, whereas the body has a pure material substantialness, and thus is directly
 connected with everything material, so therefore also with illness, unfortune and every hardship, as it is on the
 other hand also with health, fortune etc.

### #95 (Chapter 25)

 But the spirit or the spirit-form needs the human consciousness for its own evolution, therefore also the body,
 wherethrough the consciousness and the body are connected with the spirit-form; if however the body be-
 comes weak or suppressed through any powers, then the consciousness can no longer evolve completely,
 because it will concentrate itself only on a specific direction, wherethrough everything else is neglected, and
 therefore no general consciousness-based evolution will occur, but only a purposeful and one-sided one; this
 will however lead to the swinging waves of the consciousness becoming too lifeless to bring the entire scope
 of its full power into the entire materialness of the body, thus the latter begins to suffer here and there.

### #96 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore, if you want to suppress an illness or minimise or resolve an existing one, then you must put a great
 pressure on your body in a consciousness-based wise, by concentrating solely on the illness or the afflicted
 area, through which the illness or the pain resolves, in which case you however leave the rest of the body com-
 pletely out of your attention, which can in turn be befallen by illness or pain; this is the same effect as when
 you have toothache which you push away in yourselves through fear when you go to the dentist.

### #97 (Chapter 25)

 The fact is that such states of arousal are often brought about through you, you humankind of Earth, and can
 be repeated several times without danger, but not permanently, otherwise serious harm will occur and endless
 sufferings will be the result.

### #98 (Chapter 25)

 If however false teachers, false prophets, gurus, masters, godly ones, sublime ones or other idolised human
 beings advise you to do so nevertheless, then they infringe against the natural creational laws and recommen-
 dations, because consider, you shall treat your body as a valueful treasure that has been entrusted to you and
 keep it safe as such, so as to bring about a healthy harmony between it and your consciousness as well as with
 your spirit; you shall therefore not harm your body and also not rob it of the life through suicide or commis-
 sioned murder.

### #99 (Chapter 25)

 If you suppress or maltreat your body, then you do the same with your consciousness, as a result an evolution and a rise up to the truth is not possible anymore, because this gives rise only to a drastic hindrance that pre-
vents any fulfilment of the task of your life; even the materialness of the body itself is affected, because the full power of the consciousness goes thereby lost in terms of its activity in the whole physical body, because the consciousness-power, which must harmonise with the material body, is enslaved.

### #100 (Chapter 25)

 If however you are irrationally taught in this through false leaders, prophets, helpers, gurus, teachers or masters
 etc., then these are less than you yourselves, because they misteach you and cheat you with false knowledge,
 because they do not know the tasks and the evolution-necessity as well as the function of your consciousness,
 whereas you dedicate yourselves to being taught the truth honestly in all things, so you are therefore truth-
 searchers, who are however deceived with irrational teachings through vermins of your consciousness who
 falsely call themselves truth-knowers.

### #101 (Chapter 25)

 If however you do not follow the real truth, then you must painfully recognise again and again your own
 foolishness and gain bitter experiences that you live through with anguish; thus you shall dedicate yourselves
 neither to religious, esoteric, ideological nor to philosophical or occult belief-forms, but solely and exclusively
 to the creational truth of all truth, that you find only in yourselves as well as in the nature and in the laws and
 recommendations of the Creation; if however you dedicate yourselves to the false teachers and the false
 prophets and the like, who spread false teachings, then you shall continue to hunger for the truth, because all
 the truth-unknowers give you only the stones of the unknowledge for nourishment, however not the bread of
 the truth.

### #102 (Chapter 25)

 Thus, you humankind of Earth, do not let yourselves be made irrational through false teachings of false
 prophets and teachers, not through masters, gurus or the like, as well as not through religions, ideologies and
 philosophies etc., because all of them are only dedicated to the irrationality, and worship gods and tin gods,
 as a result of which they turn away from the truth of the Creation and from its laws and recommendations,
 through which the becoming and passing of the life and of all things are determined.

### #103 (Chapter 25)

 Search not for the personified evil, not for a devil and not for an antichrist etc., because that which is the evil
 and the devilish exists in yourselves, therefore you must search for and fight against them in yourselves, and
 not search for them outside yourselves or in an imaginary hell, which is truthly nothing other than your state
 in yourselves, which you create through your thoughts and feelings and out of which you commit evil deeds
 and bring forth miserable activities.

### #104 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, being only a little awake is enough for you to recognise the falsehood of the godly teachings that
 the bearers and representatives of the earthly religions, ideologies and philosophies talk you into believing,
 who are only directed towards their earthly might and its expansion.

### #105 (Chapter 25)

 They thereby very clearly bring forth that they are the servants of their human intellect, which is directed solely
 towards school, religious, ideological and philosophical knowledge, and stands hindering and hostile towards
 everything which stands in connection with the actual truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations
 and lies outside of their extremely inadequate knowledge.

### #106 (Chapter 25)

 Through the religious, ideological and philosophical irrational teachings, you humankind of Earth, the truth of
 all truth remains outside of your earthly intellect-based knowledge, as does the truth of the spiritual and of the
 consciousness-based.

### #107 (Chapter 25)

 And it is actually your intellect and your rationality that you have brought into a malicious form of unintellect
 and irrationality through your belief in a godhead or a tin god, because through your belief you have wrongly
 learnt to consider something as true whose existence you cannot prove neither externally nor in yourselves,
 and thus your irrationality and your unintellect are the real hindrance for your not finding the effective truth
 either in yourselves or in the creational laws and recommendations, and indeed, because you are addicted and
 in submissive bondage to your belief as well as to the unintellect and irrationality.

### #108 (Chapter 25)

 You have in this kind become in yourselves opponents of the truth and thereby also opponents of the Creation
 and the creational spirit-form in you, which is why you turn away from the teaching of the truth, the teaching
 of the spirit and the teaching of the life, which has been brought to you since time immemorial through the
 true prophets as the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› and the ‹Goblet of the Truth›.

### #109 (Chapter 25)

 You build as highest and topmost on your intellect and your rationality, but to truly use both of them is some-
 thing you do not understand and cannot do, because you are captured through your belief in a godhead, tin
 god or idolised human beings and are so helpless that you – because you do not know yourselves – cannot
 build up out of your own cognition the power for your own liberation, therefore you need a truthly guidance as
 to what it looks like in your inner nature, what you are doing wrong and what you must do in order to become
 yourselves, in order to win cognitions according to your own personality and in order to create love, peace and
 harmony in your own inner nature; but you must make use of and do everything yourselves, since this can be
 done neither by a true prophet nor by those who, as false prophets, teachers, gurus and masters etc., swarm
 around you like poisonous insects that sting you and want to bring you death and ruin.

### #110 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, it is so that the bearers and representatives and all the fanatics of all religions, sects, ideologies and philosophies, of the esoteric and of the whole occultism fear that they may lose their influence amongst you,
you humankind of Earth, through the clarification of the truthly truth of all truth, as it is given through the Creation in its laws and recommendations.

### #111 (Chapter 25)

 This is the main reason for all calumnies against the truth, whereas the following reason is to be found in the
 belief of the bearers and representatives of the false religions, ideologies and philosophies.

### #112 (Chapter 25)

 They however do not know the reality of the real truth, namely that no god or creator is the origin of all things
 and all existence, but the Creation itself, which has let everything come to be through its idea, from out of
 which it has also created its creational laws and recommendations, out of which all effects imaginable arise
 through cause and effect, wherethrough nothing comes about through haphazard, i.e. through chance but
 only through the foreordination and determination, hence everything all around has its regulation and there is
 no chaos.

### #113 (Chapter 25)

 There are only a few amongst you, you humankind of Earth, who know the reality and the truth about the
 Creation and about its activating laws and recommendations, as well as the sense of the life that is given in
 you in the evolution of the consciousness and of the spirit as spirit-form; and since you are only a few, it be-
 comes balefully apparent that you others, you unknowers, are slaves of yourselves and of your religious, sec-
 tarian, ideological or philosophical belief and are only fighting amongst people of your kind for influence and
 might.

### #114 (Chapter 25)

 And if you await clear evidence of the reality of the real truth, then you can find it only in yourselves as well
 as in the creational laws and recommendations, because you will not find such evidence in the belief in a god-
 head, but only opposing things against the truth and its deep reality.

### #115 (Chapter 25)

 True and honest words against the truth do not exist, but rather only ones that are false, full of lies and calum-
 nious, and those who use them fight openly against the truth and raise the evil up as worthy of worship; and
 all are driven to this, all whose intellect and rationality are insane, and whose power for the recovery becomes
 constantly more inadequate.

### #116 (Chapter 25)

 In the rationality and intellect of the truth-unknowers, who believe in a god or tin god or in human idols etc.,
 the calumny concerning the truth sprawls like a poisonous growth as a tool of evil, which has become to you,
 you humankind of Earth, of all dangers the most dangerous.

### #117 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, your human intellect and your rationality have, through an incongruously rapid advancement with regard
 to the religious, ideological and philosophical belief, become factors of the fanaticism and of you no longer
 being able to distinguish truth and untruth, love and hatred as well as knowledge and belief, and reality and
 unreality from each other, and consequently are no longer able to separate them.

### #118 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore you can no longer realise that behind everything there is the evil that you live out and that you have
 created in yourselves through your own free will, and now have the greatest arduousness to recognise it, fight
 against it and resolve it.

### #119 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, only then, if you finally fight the evil in yourselves, if you turn to the truth, will it be possible for you
 to become righteous, responsible, conscientious and full of love, peace, freedom and harmony in a fully cons-
 cious wise, so that one day – sooner or later – you can raise your head in deference towards the life, your fel-
 low human beings and everything around you and stand here as true human beings.

### #120 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, do not belong to the groupings of those truth-deniers who raise themselves up in
 the fanaticism to the terrorism through the hostile fight against the effective truth and the creational laws and
 recommendations in the name of their religious, ideological or philosophical belief, and murder people of your
 kind for the sake of their belief, wherethrough they become the personified evil and the scourge of the true
 love, of the peace, of the freedom and of the harmony, the values of which you have been longing for since
 time immemorial.

### #121 (Chapter 25)

 If however you want to experience the values of the love, of the peace, of the freedom and of the harmony
 in yourselves, then you must wake up out of your leaden sleep of the truth-unknowledgeness, you humankind
 of Earth, and lay down the heavy burden of the irresponsibility, the consciencelessness and the unright that
 you bear and that weighs on you thousand millions of human beings like heavy stones.

### #122 (Chapter 25)

 Cast off your burden, because it is not worth bearing, not even for a fraction of a nanosecond, and moreover
 it presses you down so deeply that you lose your self-esteem.

### #123 (Chapter 25)

 But also clear out the empty chaff from your thoughts that you have gathered through belief-forms regarding
 a god, tin god or an idolised human being and that flutter away and disperse themselves everywhere if it is
 struck by even one breath of the truth.

### #124 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, as truth-unknowers, as unknowers with regard to the Creation and its laws and recommendations, you
 have wasted the time, the energy and power of your up-till-now life for effectively nothing valueful but only for
 senselessnesses and terribleness, which you have suggestively and forcefully brought about through religions,
 ideologies and philosophies, namely for wars, revolts, death penalties, hatred, jealousy as well as for murder
 and manslaughter, terror, unfreedom and unpeace, together with crime, whoring, strife, revenge and retribu-
 tion, lying, deception and calumny, etc.
 
### #125 (Chapter 25)

 But it is time that you finally liberate yourselves from all these evil terrible things, that you break the chains of
 all evil that hold you down and keep you away from all that which is of the good and truthly.

### #126 (Chapter 25)

 If however you remain captured in your thoughts and feelings through your belief in religions, ideologies or
 philosophies and thus in a godhead, tin god or idolised human being, then you will continue to suffer in blatant
 untruth, irresponsibility, unrighteousness and consciencelessness.

### #127 (Chapter 25)

 And if you continue to persist in the unright and in the untruth, then you bind yourselves always anew with
 that which you learn wrongly through belief-dogmas and other false tenets, because with the new learning or
 in the holding fast to belief-based concerns you force yourselves ever deeper into strange forms that fix them-
 selves as strange authorities in you and rule you.

### #128 (Chapter 25)

 These strange forms, which others have thought up and think up for you and that you willingly take on, they
 all include you in strange persuasions, i.e. convictions and make you into slaves of false and strange goods of
 thoughts, which as a strange authority takes over the might in your thoughts and feelings as well as in your
 attitude; truthly, through the keeping of strange forms, i.e. authorities, you merely make that your own what
 others have thought up, invented and bent into form in themselves and which they throw to you so that you
 pick it up and without thinking believe in it, without searching for the truth in your inner nature through using
 your intellect and your rationality, because you eschew the arduousness thereto and would rather believe and
 bear no responsibility.

### #129 (Chapter 25)

 It is quite right that you, you humankind of Earth, are as individuals not all alike and that a great differenti-
 atedness is given from the one human being to the other, where the one thing is not for everyone, and it is
 such that the one thing is of use to one human being, but brings difficulties to another; therefore, also, the lear-
 ning of the effective truth differs in the form of the approach, so everyone must find their own way therefor
 in order to go the way of the truth in themselves, which is itself the truth and the culmination-point; therefo-
 re everyone must find their own way to the way of the truth, in order to fathom the truth on it, and to win
 thereout the relatively highest possible cognition and understanding.

### #130 (Chapter 25)

 The requisite for the finding of the way to the way of the truth is different from the one human being to the
 other, as are the capabilities that must be acquired, directed and used thereto, so that it can be upbuilt upon
 them.

### #131 (Chapter 25)

 Whoever cannot achieve their requisite that is necessary to find the way to reach the way of the truth, which
 is itself the truth and the culmination-point, they also cannot recognise themselves and remain strangers in
 themselves; and with regard to what might be learnt, they always remain standing beside it and cannot use it,
 because it cannot become living in them, therefore any inner and understandable gain is impossible, and only
 a vegetating away is possible, however a progress is impossible, since they do not really and seriously strive
 after the light of the truth.

### #132 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore watch out, you humankind of Earth, if you really and honestly want to search for the truth given
 through the Creation and through its laws and recommendations and which you can find therein and in your-
 selves, because you must know that the way of the truth is in you alone and it is also the truth itself, therefore
 it is only you as individuals who can discover it and walk on it; and only then, if you follow the way of the truth
 and also experience and live it with all the developmental changes, will you have fully comprehended it, and
 will learn to understand the truthly truth of all truth, which is free of any belief of any kind and is pure knowl-
 edge and wisdom.

### #133 (Chapter 25)

 Also while learning the real truth, joy and affliction are permanent companions, but you humankind of Earth,
 you shall not let yourselves be saddened through the affliction and shall not fall into over-courage through the
 joy, because you shall use joy and affliction to shake up and encourage yourselves to really awaken in your
 consciousness as well as in your thoughts and feelings.

### #134 (Chapter 25)

 And if you do so, you will be freed from all daily nothingnesses, and thus you feel in the joy and also in the
 affliction as well as in the wellbeing and in the pain, the welldoing connection with the energy and power of
 the Creation and all its love, which streams through everything living, also you, you humankind of Earth.

### #135 (Chapter 25)

 See the truth: Everything existent of all existence is true life, because nothing is integrated into the lifelessness,
 but rather into constant developmental change in the becoming and passing and re-becoming, therefore,
 good for you, you amongst you human beings, who realise the profound moments of the connection with the
 love of the all-embracing Creation, can hold onto it and are able to swing yourselves upwards on it.

### #136 (Chapter 25)

 But you are only able do this if you are yourselves and create everything in your own inner nature on your own,
 and do not hold onto a godhead, tin god, idolised human being, and neither onto any religious, ideological or
 philosophical and rigid belief-forms, but rather solely and exclusively onto the truthly truth of all truth, as it is
 laid down through the Creation and its laws and recommendations.

### #137 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore, you humankind of Earth, you must strive and evolve as individuals in yourselves, from out of your
 own consciousness as well as out of the thoughts and feelings, in order to come to the truth and to the fine-
 spiritual perceiving of the love of the Creation, so there can be true love and harmony as well as freedom and
 peace in you, in order to then also carry forth these high values, so that you, you humankind of Earth, may
 profit from them and so that everything may turn to the best wellbeing amongst you all.
 
### #138 (Chapter 25)

 You, who strive after the truth, heed yourselves and not the mockers, who are still not open to the truth and
 the truth-life and stand like ones who are ill in their consciousness or like drunken ones in front of all the great
 miracles of the works of the Creation, which offer so much, but are not seen and not understood by them,
 because they are seeing blind ones, who grope their way helplessly through the life and push aside everything
 splendid of the Creation, because they do not realise it in its reality.

### #139 (Chapter 25)

 And you, who strive after the truth, be not confused and do not sleep while learning, so that you really recog-
 nise the truth and not claim that only that which you see with your eyes is real, and that there is no life where
 you cannot perceive any movement with your eyes; truly, this is not the truth, because even when, with the
 dying of your body, you cease to be yourselves, the life still continues through the spirit-form that disappears
 into its realm of the other world in order to be reborn at its time, in a new body and with a new conscious-
 ness and a new personality.

### #140 (Chapter 25)

 Do not therefore be blind with seeing eyes and do not deny the living as the opposite merely because there are many things you cannot see, that are hidden from your seeing, and that nevertheless exist in full aliveness.

### #141 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, there are many things you do not yet know, because your abilities and senses are restricted, so you also
 do not know and do not understand that not only with space and time are there many things connected,
 which you have to learn through your consciousness, but also with regard to your spirit, i.e. the spirit-form, which
 as a minute part of the Creation animates the human consciousness, the mental-block and the consciousness-
 block as well as the body and cannot be perceived with the material senses, the eyes, the ears or through the
 sense of touch, not through the feelings, not through the smelling or tasting, but solely and exclusively through
 the fine-spiritual perceiving, which stems out of the spirit realm itself and comes via the subconsciousness into
 the material realm of the psyche and consciousness.

### #142 (Chapter 25)

 It is a fact however that not everything that rises above space and time can be perceived through your human,
 material senses, because all things beyond the space and beyond the time are integrated into more fine-fluidal
 levels and forms, which in turn can be perceived only through factors, which are laid out for this, such as the
 spiritual Gemüt, which is capable of the fine-spiritual perception; you humankind of Earth, however, you have
 not yet found any logical intellectual evidence for this, because through your religious, ideological or philo-
 sophical belief you are captured in irrational teachings that lie far from all truth of the true spiritual life, whose
 fundamental existence lies in the Creation, in its love as well as in its laws and recommendations; and all this
 lies beyond the earthly or material scaling of space and time, which, however, needs a further way of the fath-
 oming of the truth for this to be recognised and understood.

### #143 (Chapter 25)

 Truth is, you humankind of Earth, that you do not even really see that with your eyes what can be specified in
 space and time, not even that which is in a single drop of water, so you can only see the life in it if you use a
 strong microscope, through which you see millions of living creatures that struggle with each other for their
 existence.

### #144 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, there are living creatures in the water, in the air, in the earth as well as in and around all plants, and in
 your food, that you cannot see with your eyes, only through equipment that magnifies them hundreds, thou-
 sands and millions of times, and it is the tiniest living creatures that possess the energy and power and the
 capability to keep your human body alive or to destroy it, although they are so tiny that you cannot perceive
 them with your eyes.

### #145 (Chapter 25)

 So you shall not be audacious and dare to claim that you cannot see and fathom anything new and as yet
 unknown, because of all the manifold things that exist purely in your materially recognisable configuration of
 space and time, you do not yet know even as much of them as a minute speck of dust of a weight, so you
 can look and look both in your time and in all future times, and still find no end in the observing and consid -
 ering, perceiving and fathoming.

### #146 (Chapter 25)

 So in the expanses of the universe you will also find new worlds, fly to them and open them up for yourselves,
 as you will also come into contact with foreign people from foreign worlds, and connect yourselves with them –
 you shall think this over.

### #147 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you have a great outlook onto the future and of the ongoing further development,
 but you have no outlook onto its end, as you have no outlook into the world of the purely spiritual and of the
 death, which is why the true prophets teach you about it, so that you search for the truth about it in yourselves
 and can find it, so that you become knowing, wise and therein full of the truth, and direct your lives according
 to the creational laws and recommendations.

### #148 (Chapter 25)

 You however amongst you who do not search for the truth, you live in selfishness and imperiousness and set yourselves as self-raised godly judges over your fellow human beings, in which case you become unhuman
through your belief in a godhead, a tin god or idolised human beings, and you become irrational and fall into
a blind-raging fanaticism and cowardly murder masses of human beings who believe otherwise through assas-
sinations; and you others who also raise yourselves up as judges over life and death, because you are lustful
for murder and greedy for riches, you animate your fellow human beings to commit suicide and take joy in
their dying and possessions, once you have murderously given them the deadly poison, and truly you thereby make yourselves guilty of the murder.

### #149 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, you humankind of Earth, you only make yourselves thoughts and feelings about your material life,
 as a result of which you fully leave the death and the realm of the other world out of your attention, because
 on the one hand you are cowardly afraid of it and eschew it, and on the other hand you are too presumptuous
 to think of it.

### #150 (Chapter 25)

 You do not know what the death is, nor what the realm of the other world is, hence you also cannot under-
 stand the two and cannot know that after every dying there is a new living existence of a new personality, and
 therefore the running circle of the life always continues; and this process from the birth, of the life and dying
 and of the death, i.e. of the death-life is taught to you and explained through the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›,
 so that you may become knowing and wise and thus become bearing of the truth.

### #151 (Chapter 25)

 The realm of the other world is a spirit-energetical sphere that lies on another side of all your material re-
 cognition-capabilities, i.e. all of your material senses and all imaginations, but is nevertheless existent and con-
 nected with the material world, however, both spheres are differently dimensioned and nevertheless cannot
 be separated from each other.

### #152 (Chapter 25)

 There is thus no cleft between these two levels, rather a stepless going over, so both build a oneness, as does
 everything in the entire Creation.

### #153 (Chapter 25)

 The spiritual-creational energy and power of the Creation streams through both the realm of the material
 world of this world and the realm of the other world, so in both dimensions, i.e. levels everything is being pulsed
 through with the same life-stream and is connected with one another.

### #154 (Chapter 25)

 Nonetheless, it is wrong to assume that both levels would be integrated into the same laws, since in this regard
 there is a difference given between the realm of the material and the realm of the spiritual; the material realm
 can fall ill through all kinds of inequity and come to harm, whereas the purely spiritual realm, to which the
 realm of the other world also belongs, is taboo with regard to all inequity and harm.

### #155 (Chapter 25)

 Only the material realm of the existence, i.e. life can be befallen in a harming wise, not however the spirit-realm,
 and therefore also not the spirit, i.e. the spirit-form, because it cannot be attacked from out of the material
 realm and cannot be influenced negatively.

### #156 (Chapter 25)

 It must be understood that the spirit, i.e. the spirit-form of you human beings is not the factor out of which
 ideas and thoughts result, contrary to how the religious, psychological and philosophical irrational teachings
 explain, because ideas and thoughts come solely out of the energy and power of the consciousness, therefore
 there is no ‹spiritual property› for ideas and thoughts, but only a ‹consciousness-property›.

### #157 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore, out of this it follows, you humankind of Earth, that it is not your spirit, i.e. not your spirit-form that
 can fall ill, but solely and exclusively your consciousness, so there is no spirit-illness, but only a consciousness-
 illness.

### #158 (Chapter 25)

 Your material body is also susceptible to illness, in contradiction to the spirit-body, as the spirit-form, i.e. the
 spirit in you is also called as the most minute part of the Creation itself, i.e. its spirit energy.

### #159 (Chapter 25)

 And since only your consciousness can fall ill, it can also fall ill to unknowledge and truth-unknowledgeness,
 whereas, however, the illness of unknowledge and of truth-unknowledgeness is healable, namely through a
 learning of the truth and the knowledge; other consciousness-illnesses however can be unhealable during the
 time of an actual life, such as constantly acute insanity or other constantly acute lunacy; other consciousness-
 illnesses however can be healable through appropriate medicines etc.

### #160 (Chapter 25)

 Consider however the realm of this world and the realm of the other world, you humankind of Earth, that both
 are a oneness in themselves however together also form an unseparable whole, because in the whole realm
 of the Creation every particle is a oneness in itself, however united with its opposite particle again a completed
 oneness, and indeed given in such a wise that one particle has a negative and the other particle a positive energy
 and power.

### #161 (Chapter 25)

 Thus in the whole realm of the Creation there is no separation, only a union, so on the one hand everything
 is in itself alone for itself autonomously a oneness, whereas everything unified together again results autono-
 mously in a whole; the term separation is thus solely an invention of you human beings to split things off from
 each other, whereas you, however, also split all creational things into two parts that in truth belong together,
 such as the life and the death and the realm of this world and the realm of the other world; and you do this
 because you separate off that which you cannot see with your eyes and otherwise cannot perceive with your
 material senses, and you assume yourselves to be the main point and the epicentre in your material surround -
 ings.

### #162 (Chapter 25)

 If you look at and consider yourselves and your possibilities, you humankind of Earth, then you may realise that
 your activity-circle and your perception-possibilities are very much greater than you generally assume and bring
 to use.

### #163 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, with your concept and behaviour of the separation you are living in great erroneous assumption, and through this you become curtailed with Gewaltsamkeit through yourselves and become as hindered in your progress as
in your development, i.e. the evolution of your consciousness, as well as with regard to the truth-knowledge.

### #164 (Chapter 25)

 The lack of the truth-knowledge leads you into the temptation of indulging in imaginations and in unbridled
 fantasies and in creating monster-like pictures of the untruth with regards to all things that you cannot see,
 perceive, recognise and understand; therefore it is not surprising that you indulge in a religious, ideological or
 philosophical belief, that you believe in gods and tin gods, demons and idolised human beings and are far from
 all sense of the truthly truth and reality and put on an unknowing smile concerning the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, that is proclaimed and taught to you through the true prophets;
 you ridicule and slander the real truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations and fall into the
 morbid worship of your godhead, your tin god or your idolised human beings, in which case you enslave your-
 selves to them and get very badly out of the control of the good human nature to the point of fanaticism, in
 which you then massacre, murder and rob your fellow human beings for the sake of their different belief, their
 knowledge or their being of another kind, which you then full of mockery equate with godly love, punishment
 and fairness.

### #165 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, because of your belief in gods, tin gods and idolised human beings of all kinds you cannot even be aston-
 ished at your own wrong doing, which is characterised by anxiety, shy fear and horror, because you already
 make these grow in you through the in any case wrong religious, ideological or philosophical education that
 has been wrongly taught to you through the parents or others with educational authority or that you teach
 yourselves.

### #166 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, uncountable ones amongst you, you humankind of Earth, you have not grown up or do not grow
 up, because your consciousness has remained stuck or remains stuck in the puberty through the wrong edu-
 cation you have received, while your body grows older and takes on the forms of the adulthood.

### #167 (Chapter 25)

 And since puberty is the factor of pre-adulthood, however is often not used by you human beings to become
 really adult with regard to an adult-individuality, some of the pubescent behaviour carries into the whole life
 and no longer changes, or only changes somewhat when specific learning circumstances arise, and indeed
 amongst both the male and the female sex.

### #168 (Chapter 25)

 Puberty is the actual ‘Rambo time’ (time of brutality), particularly of the male human being, although the female
 sex is also not excluded from this, and what is not learnt in this time with regard to a positive development of
 the individuality, i.e. the inner nature is generally not learnt afterwards either, as there is also a continuation in
 the life concerning anything bad and negative that has not been cast aside.

### #169 (Chapter 25)

 Thus, the self-education in the stage of the puberty is of utmost importance, since that which must be learnt
 in this time and through which the individuality, i.e. the inner nature must be formed determines the further
 life until the old age, and out of this reason it is very difficult for you, you humankind of Earth, to still change
 to the good and the better, before you have left the time of the puberty, which can stretch from the age of 10
 to 17 or even 19; and since the puberty is connected both to the physical development and to the conscious-
 ness-development, the individuality is also included therein, and is formed until the end of the puberty, which
 means that during the puberty-time the most important forms of the individuality, i.e. of the inner nature are
 formed and this process accompanies great circumstances of tension, as a result physiological and hormonal
 changes to the body and consciousness are brought about, which is why the puberty is also a phase of social,
 thought-feeling-based as well as psychical unequalisedness.

### #170 (Chapter 25)

 As a rule, the behaviour in the puberty is characterised by strong excitement as well as by feeling-ambivalence,
 i.e. feeling-doubtfulness, i.e. being torn in the feelings, i.e. relationship-contradictoriness and feeling-over-
 boarding, connected with a protesting behaviour against the adults and fellow human beings in general,
 through which orientation-difficulties in the social domain etc. come about.

### #171 (Chapter 25)

 And if some or all of the negative factors of the puberty are not mastered, worked upon and not brought
 under control through a healthy social and life-based attitude by the end of the puberty-time, and thus influ-
 enced the main form of the individuality, i.e. the inner nature, then the human being remains totally or par-
 tially stuck in his or her puberty and carries forward everything into the whole coming life.

### #172 (Chapter 25)

 The puberty serves you, you humankind of Earth, through the effects of the creational laws and recommendations, to evolve to true human beings and become grown up, so that you may live rightfully, in responsibility, righteous-
ness and conscientiousness and that you let nothing evil rise up in you; if however you do not follow the guid -
ance of the laws and recommendations that are creational, and if you do not use the time and the possibilities of
the puberty, then you will live all your life totally or partly in that state, and indeed with all or some of the
puberty-attributes, which is why you will fall prey to all terrible things, the murdering, the hatred and jealousy,
the acting with Gewalt, the unpeace and stinginess, the unfreedom, war, disharmony, the pathological craving
for revenge and the pathological craving for retaliation, the avarice as well as everything else that is of the evil.

### #173 (Chapter 25)

 Be therefore already concerned in your time of the puberty to become true human beings, because after that
 time it will be so arduous and onerous for you to do so, that you can accomplish it only with great exceptions,
 therefore the rule is such that you will remain in all the Ausartungen and live them out throughout your life as
 you have brought them up in your puberty.
 
### #174 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, if you do not fully come out of your puberty, it will last totally or partially during your whole life, so
 you will not really become an adult, because adulthood does not mean that you become an adult when your
 body has grown out of the youth-age, rather you are adults only then, when you have mastered your puberty
 and have proceeded out of it to become a true human being; if however that is not the case, then you will
 also, during your life after the time of youth, be more or less, in small or big parts, captives of your puberty-
 factors.

### #175 (Chapter 25)

 Indeed, the puberty-influences are, in the normal case, worked upon amply, so no factors thereof are carried
 forward into the life, which however does not mean that many of you, you humankind of Earth, are not able
 to work out certain parts of the puberty-problems and thus take parts of them over into the life and have to
 bear them throughout their lifetime, such as aggression, acting with Gewalt, hatred, disharmony, jealousy, feel-
 inglessness, being torn in the feelings, pathological craving for revenge, pathological craving for strife etc.,
 which does not rarely lead to murder and manslaughter and even to deeds of war; therefore these are to a
 large extent factors that must be brought under control in the puberty, which is, however, due to a lack of cor-
 rect education through parents or others with educational authority as well as through the wrong self-educa-
 tion amongst many of you, you humankind of Earth, not given in great measure.

### #176 (Chapter 25)

 Your self-education has not ended with the end of the puberty-time, because even afterwards it is given that
 you human beings must work on yourselves throughout your lifetime, in order to become ever truer in being
 human in the real and true sense; but these factors of learning are not puberty-moments carried over into the
 life, but rather normal life-based learning functions, through which possibilities are given to influence the indi-
 viduality, i.e. the inner nature and to form it further to the good and better.

### #177 (Chapter 25)

 Throw away everything that is terrible already in your puberty so that you do not torment yourselves with it throughout your life and do not bring terribleness upon yourselves and upon your fellow human beings.

### #178 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, bring down the pubertal barriers that you have raised up in you as an erroneous
 assumption and have taken over into the life, because only if you bring down these barriers, even though this
 is immensely difficult, will your life have stability and your whole humankind will have the chance that true love
 and freedom as well as harmony and peace will come amongst you.

### #179 (Chapter 25)

 Your previous wrong attitude towards the life and the duties thereof has created in you a completely wrong
 basis on which you strive fully in vain, despite great plans and deeds, to find the real truth of all truth in your-
 selves and in the creational laws and recommendations, which you could build up in yourselves as all-embra-
 cing knowledge and great wisdom.

### #180 (Chapter 25)

 If you strive for the effective truth, as you can find it in yourselves and in the laws and recommendations of
 the Creation, then you come across things that free you from your fickleness and your doubts and compul-
 sions, and shatter your whole construct of the irresponsibility, unrighteousness and consciencelessness, so that
 you also lose your pusillanimity and give up your resentment.

### #181 (Chapter 25)

 If you, you humankind of Earth, however do not follow this guidance, then every one of you will have to bear the disadvantage all alone, as a result, there will be no advancement for you, neither with regard to a progress
in the individuality, i.e. in the formation of the inner nature, nor with regard to the consciousness-evolution.

### #182 (Chapter 25)

 If you leave the guidance of the progress and the development out of your attention, then you will stand still
 in useless stagnation, or you will even retreat and fall back into old things and vices etc. that you had ardu-
 ously mastered and brought behind you.

### #183 (Chapter 25)

 And if you do not follow the guidance, then you lengthen your way that you must arduously go for the sake
 of your general progress and your consciousness-evolution.

### #184 (Chapter 25)

 But if you find the way of the truth in you, which is itself the truth and the culmination-point, then you will
 bring together knowledge upon knowledge and build it up according to the principle of “constant dripping
 fills the glass”, thus you will become ever more knowing and wiser in the truth and will begin to live it.

### #185 (Chapter 25)

 And if you have finally comprehended the truth in its entirety as it truthly is, then you will tread on the right
 way of the life and will get ever closer to the actual culmination-point which is given in the evolution of your
 consciousness.

### #186 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, if you reach this culmination point and strive for the ongoing consciousness-evolution, then the rise
 up to it will make you great joy and will bring you satisfaction.

### #187 (Chapter 25)

 In the rising-up in the consciousness-evolution you can then feel and understand the interaction between all
 things, how they pulse with the warmness of the life through the whole, through the oneness which is given
 through the creational and which thus connects everything with each other in an interacting wise, because
 everything is driven and held in its existence, life and activity by the creational energy and power; and if you
 comprehend and understand this, then the shining light of the truth will ignite in you, through which you will
 fill your life with love and strive unstoppably after the being human in the real and true sense, after peace,
 freedom and harmony for yourselves and for your whole humankind.

### #188 (Chapter 25)

 You however, you humankind of Earth, you must do a lot in order to become true human beings, because many of you live merely in comfort and indolence, which are, together with other things, causes of your mockery
against the real truth, because you eschew the efforts to push over the false that you have so far gathered in
terms of what you have thought, felt and learnt, consequently you are not able to build up anything new, truthly, valueful and realistic in yourselves.

### #189 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you who go along in this wise, you are not able to regulate your accustomed and wrong leading of life
 in order to bring about a new, healthy and right mode of life, for it is extremely uncomfortable for you to wring
 the necessary effort from yourselves for this.

### #190 (Chapter 25)

 Those however amongst you, you humankind of Earth, who are more knowing and wiser than the truth-
 unknowers, do not let the unknowers regarding the truth and therefore also not the irresponsible ones and
 the conscienceless ones deprave and do not quarrel with them, but helpfully offer them your knowledge and
 your wisdom, and teach them the truthly truth.

### #191 (Chapter 25)

 Do not leave those in the truth-unknowledge who search for the truth and have predominantly come so far
 to no longer dedicate themselves to the passing pleasures and to no longer be like animals, which do not think
 consciously but merely fill their stomachs with nourishment and live according to their impulses.

### #192 (Chapter 25)

 If they ask you about the real truth and about the creational laws and recommendations as well as about the
 Creation itself, then teach them and give them the cognition for which they ask; and consider, what you pass
 on in knowledge and wisdom will in turn interactingly increase your knowledge and your wisdom.

### #193 (Chapter 25)

 In the whole realm of the Creation, in the universe and in everything that exists therein, the eternal law of
 cause and effect works, and included in this is also the giving and taking, i.e. the presentation and acceptance
 of enduring values.

### #194 (Chapter 25)

 This law reaches very deeply and weaves through the whole Creation itself and also as its bequest everything
 that has come into existence through it.

### #195 (Chapter 25)

 The giving and taking, presentation and acceptance shall also be a bequest for you, you humankind of Earth,
 and indeed to your fellow human beings, to whom you shall selflessly give and help in all things where there
 is hardship; thus you shall also pass on your knowledge and your wisdom of the teaching of the truth, the
 teaching of the spirit and the teaching of the life to your next ones and your fellow human beings, if they ask
 for it; you shall however also bring forward understanding for the misery and the hardship as well as for the
 inabilities of your next ones and fellow human beings, so that you helpfully turn to them in the right wise, for
 which you will in turn receive thanks.

### #196 (Chapter 25)

 And if you act seriously in this wise, then you will also receive help back, namely in that new energy and there-
 out power will grow in you, because you will feel well and be full of joy and satisfaction.

### #197 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, already a single true and honest thought and thereout resulting feelings that are of the same kind,
 with the wish to do good, tear down in you that invisible wall which you have created in yourselves and which,
 as a hindrance, has made you forget all kindheartedness and all giving.

### #198 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, even if you indulge in the stinginess and deny the truth, which you fear consciously or unconsciously, you are nevertheless closely and unseparably connected with the truth and with the law of giving and taking.

### #199 (Chapter 25)

 Try to set your thoughts and feelings to the giving and taking, the presenting and accepting, and indeed also
 with regard to your thoughts and feelings, because they are the messengers you send out and that return to
 you again like a boomerang, both in the good and in the evil.

### #200 (Chapter 25)

 Consider always that your thoughts and the thereout resulting feelings are swinging-wave-based energies with
 great power, that form themselves in the consciousness and become forms that strike your fellow human
 beings and bring forth distinct effects in them; these energy-rich and powerful swinging waves however also
 store themselves as fluidal-powers in your personal things, in your skeleton and in places where you live etc.,
 thus they outlast your life on Earth and your body and continue to bring forth effects long after you.

### #201 (Chapter 25)

 And consider, you humankind of Earth, also your true love contains great swinging-wave-based energies and
 powers, therefore you shall be concerned about letting the love in you become ever greater and letting it grow
 in your fellow human beings, so that all will be involved in it and are peaceful, harmonious and free amongst
 one another.

### #202 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, love is the true way of the truth and of the life, and if you do deeds of the love, then these will follow
 you, so love will therefore also be given to you in return.

### #203 (Chapter 25)

 Even thought-creations are works that catch up to you again, namely depending on how they are formed in
 the negative or positive, so they build light or dark swinging waves in you which you must get through in order
 to get into your consciousness-world; no help and also no protection can be offered to you from outside in
 this, since you live in self-determination and therefore only you alone can help yourselves; so the first step and
 every step thereafter must come from you yourselves, and you yourselves determine whether the first step and
 every step thereafter will be easy or heavy, because this lies in your thought- and feeling-world, through which
 you determine the volition in the negative or positive, so the heaven or the hell lies in you yourselves, depend-
 ing on how you decide in the good or evil.
 
### #204 (Chapter 25)

 You yourselves can decide all things, over whatever you want to assess, but for this, no god, no tin god as well
 as no idolised human being is responsible except you yourselves, so you alone must bear the consequences of
 your thoughts and feelings as well as of your volition without imposing any requirements thereto.

### #205 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you alone create everything through your own thoughts, the feelings and the there-
 out resulting deeds, which is why you alone must also bear the consequences thereout; do not therefore
 foment unpeace, unfreedom and disharmony and do not create hatred and war, but keep your thoughts and
 feelings pure in true love, so that you spread peace, freedom and harmony and give righteousness, fairness
 and conscientiousness enough consideration.

### #206 (Chapter 25)

 Be at all times watchful in your thoughts, feelings and in your deeds and do not forget that every thought created
 and sent out by you, and also every feeling, whether negative or positive, attracts everything on its way out
 which is of the same kind, and they furthermore adhere to the consciousness of many of your fellow human
 beings if they get into them, if the latter are, perhaps only for a second, unattentive, forget themselves and
 have no control over themselves, the consequence of which is that the thoughts and feelings become ever
 stronger; and if such hovering-around thoughts and feelings are given the opportunity through unattentive-
 ness etc. to get into the consciousness, then the corresponding goods of thoughts spread around, whether
 negative or positive, and thus also the thereout resulting feelings, ever more amongst people of your kind,
 where in accordance with your unequalised and unneutral goods of thoughts, the ungood, the evil and the
 negative prevail.

### #207 (Chapter 25)

 And consider what responsibility you bear with your thoughts and feelings, both with regard to yourselves and
 with regard to your fellow human beings, because your goods of thoughts and goods of feelings bring forth
 effects not merely in yourselves but also externally amongst your fellow human beings, which manifest them-
 selves in acts and deeds, and indeed, as a rule, in a negative, bad, ungood and evil form, because your
 thoughts and feelings are to a large extent of such a constitution; and if your thoughts and feelings take effect
 on any of your fellow human beings and if they put your negative, evil, bad and ungood goods of thoughts
 and goods of feelings into action, then you bear the responsibility for this.

### #208 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, you humankind of Earth have to consider that in you as a whole, as well as as an individual human being, your responsibility is triggered simply by your nourishing the ungood, negative, evil and bad thoughts
and feelings, because namely each thought and each feeling sent out by you retains a permanent connection
with you, without your being aware and conscious of it; the thoughts and feelings that you send out charge
themselves on their way out with new energy and power and return thus strengthened to you like a boomer-
ang, wherethrough you will be burdened or delighted anew with them, depending on whether your sent-out
thoughts and feelings are of a negative, evil, ungood and bad or of a positive, good, excellent and kind nature.

### #209 (Chapter 25)

 You form your own thought- and feeling-world and send this out, wherewith you also create the possibility
 that they can get into the consciousness of those of your fellow human beings, who are unattentive or who
 nourish similar thought- and feeling-forms; thus you can also be befallen by the thoughts and feelings of your
 fellow human beings, just as they can be through your own goods of thoughts and goods of feelings, there-
 fore also in this relation an interaction comes about once again, as in everything that is existent.

### #210 (Chapter 25)

 Thus, the teaching out of the creational laws and recommendations is that you shall not squander the energy
 and power of your thoughts and feelings but use them rightfully by guiding, nourishing and cherishing them
 in a good, positive, right, excellent kind and wise, and that you defend yourselves consciously against intrud-
 ing strange thoughts and feelings by making your own thoughts and feelings to a sharp defence; create in this
 wise out of your own thoughts and feelings a protection against everything which is of the ungood, the evil,
 the negative, the bad and the ausgeartet that breaks in upon you from outside, so that you do not take it on
 but rather remain free of it and you in yourselves always fight only for the good and heal wounds in the whole
 realm of everything Creation-given.

### #211 (Chapter 25)

 If you want to act in accordance with the truth and move forwards in terms of the evolution of your conscious -
 ness, then you must arrange your thoughts and feelings to this in a controlling wise, which means however
 that you must lay down many false views and shake many rigid pillars that carry the false and erroneous teach -
 ings that have made you since time immemorial to believers in godheads and gods and in idolised human
 beings as well as in religions, ideologies and philosophies.

### #212 (Chapter 25)

 Since time immemorial there have been false and irrational teachings, false terms and words, which you, you
 humankind of Earth, have received in a mistaught wise and which you comprehend wrongly and which do not
 let you find the true way of the truth, which you must search for in yourselves as way of the truth, which is
 itself the truth and the culmination-point.

### #213 (Chapter 25)

 On the way of the searching in yourselves you must return to the true way of the truth from which you have
 turned away and have not found again or have never found since time immemorial.

### #214 (Chapter 25)

 Let the light of the real truth light up in you and get into the darkness of your truth-unknowledge, so that you
 bring down the construct of the untruth in you that you have built since time immemorial and during your
 actual life, so that you may finally get to work and turn to the reality and to the truth of all truth.
 
### #215 (Chapter 25)

 Make sure, if you search for the truth and learn it, that you do not suffer anew from a standstill, that you do
 not fall into new stagnation, but take the time as an example, which does not end but goes unstoppably for-
 ward, which you shall do as well when searching for, fathoming, understanding and living the effective truth,
 as it is given in the creational laws and recommendations and that you can find both therein and in yourselves,
 if you make an effort.

### #216 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you humankind of Earth, the time passes, and indeed without you being able to do anything against it,
 and in the passing of the time all things change in your material world and in the universe as well as in your-
 selves, in your body and consciousness, in your inner nature, in the character, knowledge and the personality,
 as well as in the interests etc.; thus you see the times changingly pass you by, as you also realise every develop-
 mental change in yourselves, if only you pay attention to it, which you as a rule do not do, because truly there
 are only a few amongst you who do not make the pictures of the changes a habit but instead observe and
 perceive everything precisely and lay a firm ground out of this upon which you can build up everything further,
 to which you dedicate yourselves with interest, motivation and strong will, so that you research, fathom and
 direct yourselves according to what you learn and experience as real truth.

### #217 (Chapter 25)

 But those amongst you, you humankind of Earth, who are believers in godheads, tin gods and idolised human
 beings and who move only arduously through your life and do not research in full interest and volition for the
 truth, in order to fathom it, to experience it and to live it, it does not take long until you are confronted with
 hindrances that stand in contradiction with each other, so your will and interest break down, and everything
 doesn't fit together anymore; thus you lose yourselves in yourselves and create many gaps in the researching
 and fathoming that in spite of all your rumination you cannot close.

### #218 (Chapter 25)

 And if you have created gaps in your researching and fathoming, then you assume, if the logic no longer offers
 you any indication, because your rationality and your intellect are over-strained, that only a belief as a substi-
 tute can help you further, which results in you falling prey to false ideologies, philosophies or religions.

### #219 (Chapter 25)

 Consider the real truth of the Creation, as it is given through its laws and recommendations, it alone is reality,
 whereas every belief is wrong, irrespective of the form in which it is practised; so you shall not believe in any
 wise, also not with regard to things that you cannot understand, rather you must in all things search to under-
 stand, so that you find the real truth in everything over which you make thoughts and feelings, so also with
 regard to the effective truth and reality, wherein you can no longer be erring if you have found it and recog-
 nised it; therefore you must learn to search, fathom and understand, because otherwise you tear open the
 gigantic gate to the Hell of the endless irrationalities, and with these irrationalities you fall prey to the belief in
 godheads, tin gods and idolised human beings, as you therewith also deny the truth and the life and degrade
 them down to the evil.

### #220 (Chapter 25)

 Not comprehending, i.e. not understanding something and thus taking refuge in a belief instead of searching
 for the effective truth and fathoming it, means indolence and cowardice as well as thought- and feeling-lazi-
 ness; this however does not drive the evolution of the consciousness upwards, but rather hinders or suppres-
 ses it; thus, you humankind of Earth, raise your eyes, search for, research, fathom and test the real truth accord-
 ing to your natural instinct that is given in you by nature, so that you become truthly knowing therein and do
 not turn to a belief of any kind, which you can never prove as rightness, because each belief is based on a
 fiction which can never provide a proof-power.

### #221 (Chapter 25)

 The time is given through the Creation, the universal consciousness, and it also lives in the time, as you human-
 kind of Earth, because as an idea of the Primal-Creation it found a beginning in the big bang and has an end,
 when it reaches its age of 311 million million, 40 thousand million (311,040,000,000,
### #000 (Chapter 25)

 years by earthly time
 calculation and then forms itself to the Primal-Creation through its process of developmental change; how
 erroneous it is, therefore, to assume that the time stands still, when the Creation itself is integrated into the
 time, which it itself has created.

### #222 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore, basic thoughts with regard to the time cannot be confronted with hindrances, therefore it is also
 possible for you, you humankind of Earth, to think further than only just for the moment, because as the time
 runs, so do your thoughts and feelings and they can move forwards through the stream of the time and even
 spread forwards; if however the time stood still, there would be no movement and everything would stagnate,
 which is however not the case, because in the whole Creation, in the universal consciousness, in the universe
 and in everything created by it and existing, everything is in an unstoppable, flowing movement.

### #223 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you do not hurry towards the time but rather you go together with the time and thus also with the becoming and passing which is connected with the time; therefore you storm ahead with the
time created through the Creation, which is not eternal but restricted through the time-determined BEING of
the Creation itself, and in the passing of this time you live your life and search for the real truth of all truth.

### #224 (Chapter 25)

 The time does not stand still and does not remain the same, because it has been going since the primal begin-
 ning of the Creation and all its myriad-fold creations, thus since time immemorial, yesterday, today, tomorrow,
 in thousands of years and in all future until the end of the time, when the Creation together with all its cre -
 ations contracts and lies itself in slumber in order to appear in the new awakening as Primal-Creation.
 
### #225 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you appeared at some point in the time and were created through the activity of the
 creational laws and recommendations, and to you it is given to gain out of the womb of the Creation, where-
 through you can learn and evolve in the consciousness; and thus you can create true love, knowledge and wis-
 dom in yourselves, as well as peace, freedom and harmony, in order to spread all this outwards amongst your
 whole humankind.

### #226 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, since the beginning of all things of the Creation, everything remains stored in the collections of the time, in the storage-banks, whatever it may be, because all and everything, even the smallest speck of dust of
a weight from every one of you human beings, is saved therein, so that not even a single iota ever goes lost.

### #227 (Chapter 25)

 And thus, you humankind of Earth, as you yourselves developmentally change in your current life and in all
 your many new personalities, which you were since time immemorial in always new births, so also the Creation
 itself changes developmentally, by creating in itself ever more love, knowledge and wisdom; this happens by
 it learning through your spirit-form which gives life to you and evolves itself spiritually by integrating into itself
 everything that you create in terms of love, knowledge and wisdom, and then your spirit-form will one day
 unite with the Creation itself, long after it no longer requires a human body, but evolves further only as a pure-
 spirit-form; then the Creation takes in from it everything that your spirit-form has learnt through your love,
 your knowledge and your wisdom over many reincarnations; through that which the Creation integrates into
 itself, it evolves itself spiritually, just like you as human beings do with regard to your consciousness.

### #228 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, you do not always remain the same ones, whether you are now young or already in
 the old age, because you developmentally change in your inner nature, in your individuality, in the Wesen, as
 well as in your consciousness and on and in your body, because everything is included into the developmental
 change and it cannot be circumvented; even your spirit-form and the Creation itself are included in the change
 through the evolution and the enrichment of love, knowledge and wisdom and therefore are not permanently
 in their condition; thus the truth, the knowledge and the wisdom are also included into the developmental
 change, and indeed in the wise that they become ever more deep-grounding and more deep-reaching, the
 deeper you get into them, because through your searching, researching and fathoming you continuously gain
 further cognitions and cognisances.

### #229 (Chapter 25)

 You have since time immemorial been searching for the truth, but you constantly ask yourselves what the truth
 really is, because that which you today assume to be the truth, you will already tomorrow recognise it again
 as an erroneous assumption, but only because you have not really found the truth, but only a partial truth or
 something that you have assumed as belief, i.e. as fiction and which has no proof-power; recognise: truth is
 not belief, but truth is certainty in recognition of the reality.

### #230 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore you must strive to find the real truth, which does not leave open any doubt and is not subject to any
 erroneous assumptions, but you have to consider though that even in erroneous assumptions there may be
 truth-grains to discover that can lead to the effective truth.

### #231 (Chapter 25)

 Truth is, that all cognitions and revelations permanently change their forms in this wise, in that an achieved
 truth always brings with it further factors that must be researched and fathomed and logically lead to new
 cognitions, through which the truth deepeningly widens itself and continuously becomes increasingly relatively
 absolutely fully developed.

### #232 (Chapter 25)

 Therefore your life continues with the constant searching, researching and fathoming, in which case you ripen
 through the whole developmental change and change of the learning and the winning of cognitions, knowl-
 edge, practical experiences and their living and become steadily wiser.

### #233 (Chapter 25)

 The truth in and of itself remains always the same in its core, does not change and is eternal, but it varies for
 you human beings in its depth in the wise that it is divided into uncountable steps, i.e. levels that must be climbed
 up one after the other; this can be compared to school classes, so the first class, i.e. step, i.e. level is the lowest,
 then following an exam the next class must be climbed up, then the next one and then the next one after that,
 until the highest class, which in the consciousness-evolution corresponds to the relative absolute full-develop-
 ment.

### #234 (Chapter 25)

 The truthly truth of all truth, the creational truth of the laws and recommendations thus always remains the
 same in the depth of its core, does not change and is not subject to any developmental change, but to reach
 this core you, you humankind of Earth, must begin at the lowest level of the truth-cognition and slowly work
 yourselves deeper and deeper into the truth, layer by layer, step by step, level by level, through which your
 truth-cognition will steadily widen and become more and more compact, and you will constantly become more
 truth-knowing.

### #235 (Chapter 25)

 Since the creational truth of all truth is eternal and is relatively absolutely fully developed in its core as well as
 in and of itself, so it is, you humankind of Earth, in your earthly sense not comprehensible in its full deepness,
 therefore it can also never be pure and final for you, but only relatively absolutely fully developed according to
 what you are able to create in terms of effective truth according to your intellect and rationality.

### #236 (Chapter 25)

 In order that you can recognise and understand more of truth, it is necessary that you become more conscious - ness-based, i.e. that you use your consciousness more amply in an evolutive kind and wise, by being free of
evil, negative, ungood and ausgeartet thoughts and feelings, so you yourselves become the truth and live in the truth, so you are in yourselves permanently irradiated by the light of the truth.

### #237 (Chapter 25)

 To learn the truthly truth, which you alone can find in yourselves and in the creational laws and recommenda-
 tions, you do not need to arduously learn a science, and you also do not need to fear erroneous assumptions,
 because if you recognise the real truth, then the answer to every question becomes obvious to you in the truth
 itself; yes, you gain very much more thereby, because the questions and the answers of the truth continuously
 widen and begin to comprise everything, because you comprehend more and more with your consciousness
 and live in the truth itself.

### #238 (Chapter 25)

 And understand, you humankind of Earth, the truth of all truth is of creational nature and given through the
 creational laws and recommendations; and in this form the real truth is the active basic significance of the
 effective knowledge, which is far from any doubt and any unprovable fiction, i.e. a belief; real truth is the con-
 cordance of the actual and contradictionless, uncontrovertible knowledge about the reality which in each form
 excludes any belief-based, i.e. fictive imagination; the criterion of the truth is the realisation of the truthful
 being, in which no theoretical values inhere, but solely and exclusively the reality, in which no belief, i.e. no
 unprovable fiction finds any place.

### #239 (Chapter 25)

 You humankind of Earth, burst all your bonds of the truth-unknowledgeness that hold you down, and become
 finally free in your consciousness, so that you may search consciously for the truth and strive for it; and if you
 are confronted with hindrances, then face them with joy, because they mean for you that you are on the right
 way and are treading the way of the truth in yourselves which is itself the truth and the culmination-point and
 on which you will find new energy and power.

### #240 (Chapter 25)

 Look at and consider all hindrances on the way of the truth as proof-stones, out of which you can learn and
 resolve your errors, so new cognitions and benefits grow out of them through which you are in turn able to
 master any hindrances that arise with ever greater ease.

### #241 (Chapter 25)

 Hindrances on the way of the truth are pushed in front of you so that you learn to master them and thereout win knowledge and wisdom and strengthen your requisite for the rise up to the real truth; there may also be
hindrances that arise as the result of a guilt and that you must resolve through the truth-recognition in order
to free yourselves from it; both forms of the hindrances bring you forwards, therefore you may not avoid them.

### #242 (Chapter 25)

 Be rational and do not speak of tests and strokes of fate that strike you in the life, because these serve your
 general progress and your consciousness-evolution; nothing happens without reason, so you must also accept
 fight and affliction if you want to achieve progress and evolution, since this gives you the opportunity to resolve
 errors and to extinguish transgressions of all kinds; and truly none of you, you humankind of Earth, can be
 released from even a minute speck of dust of a weight of errors and transgressions, therefore you must work
 up everything and direct it into the lines of the rightness and of the truth; consider that the running circle of the
 becoming and passing is anchored in the creational laws and is absolutely unmovable, so also is the becoming
 and passing of the errors and the transgressions that you commit and that are revealed to you through the
 learning, so that you can resolve and extinguish them and light up the darkness in you; and if this were not
 given so through the creational laws and recommendations, then the smallest deviation therefrom would bring
 all life to extinguishment and destroy the entire universe including everything existent.

### #243 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, those amongst you, you humankind of Earth, you who have very much to clear up from your life, be it
 from today or out of the past, you shall not be faint-hearted, just as you also must not be horrified by the
 redemption of your guilt, because if you truthfully turn to the truth and are willing to resolve your errors and
 transgressions, then you can consolingly and joyfully begin with freeing yourselves from the bad, evil, negative,
 irresponsible, conscienceless, unrighteous and unfair in all things, so that you can therein without worries and
 without a bad conscience in honesty turn to that which is rightful, good and righteous, conscientious, respon-
 sible as well as positive and fair, so you have a good conscience.

### #244 (Chapter 25)

 Consider at all times that you can always create an equalisation through your energy and its power and through
 the honest will and motivated volition, through which other and positive thought-forms and out of them other
 and better feelings come to life in your consciousness, which as strong weapons make you capable of fighting
 victoriously against everything dark in you and of freeing yourselves from the burden and heaviness of the
 truth-unknowledge.

### #245 (Chapter 25)

 The energy and power of your thoughts and feelings as well as of your will and volition is for many of you an unexpected might that attracts all energies and powers of the same kind, like a magnet; and these attracted
energies and powers grow ever-stronger and unite in turn with similar or equally directed consciousness-based
mights that act backwards and return to the point of origin and thus in turn strike the sender of the thoughts
and feelings; and thus you, who are senders and receivers, will be raised up to the good and the wellbeing, or
you will be cast down and sink ever deeper in your own mud and dirt, depending on how you as originators
of the whole determine and bring about everything.

### #246 (Chapter 25)

 Thus it is given that your thoughts and feelings swing out and strike your fellow human beings, as well as that
 you are also struck by the thoughts and feelings of your fellow human beings, so therefore an interaction is
 given, as in all things of everything existing in the whole realm of the Creation-universe.

### #247 (Chapter 25)

 And if you know this constant interaction that is absolutely certain to occur, that is given through all ways in
 the entire Creation-realm and that with absolute certainty unstoppably triggers and unfolds itself again and
 again, then you can also use it and love it consciously and without fear; and if you comprehend this, then you
 can use your knowledge to impart many things through your thoughts and feelings to your fellow human
 beings that you cannot do through your words alone; and truly it is then also possible for you to be able to
 co-live the thoughts and feelings of your fellow human beings with them, because it is possible for you to per-
 ceive and logically follow their thought- and feeling-world, which has nothing to do with telepathy, however,
 but is a factor of empathy, i.e. of the ability for deep feelings for the others.

### #248 (Chapter 25)

 Through the empathy, the invisible thought- and feeling-world of your fellow human beings comes to life for
 you, step-by-step, and you receive their efficacy with such clarity that it dissolves every doubt in you, thus you
 can without making an error, take in and assess with absolute certainty the inner nature of thoughts and
 feelings of your next ones and fellow human beings.

### #249 (Chapter 25)

 You however, you humankind of Earth, you must first of all arduously learn these things, because you have
 refrained from doing so since time immemorial and have gone wrong ways of the life; you must also learn to
 receive consciously the strong energetical waves of the restless activity of the creational laws and recommen-
 dations that have an effect on you from out of the existence of the Creation; and if you pay only a little attention
 to it in a halfway conscious wise, then you will realise that the creational energies and their powers are very
 strong streams which effect in you very much of the positive, the good and the best as well as vitality and
 healing from all the unrighteous, inequitable, irresponsible and conscienceless as well as from truth-unknowl-
 edge, if you only use them consciously and willingly.

### #250 (Chapter 25)

 Truly, you are able through your thoughts and feelings and through your firm will to use the the creational
 energy- and power-streams consciously, if you really want to; but you shall use the neutral creational energies
 and powers only for good and positive purposes, not however for evil and negative ones, so that you bring
 prosperousness to yourselves and to your humankind of Earth and not lead them into depravity; you shall with
 the creational and your own consciousness-based and physical energies and powers do works of the good and
 the best, for the relative absolute fulfilment of your consciousness-evolution; you shall not however light a
 blazing fire of the depravity that perverts your true inner nature into hatred, jealousy and war, into envy and
 stinginess as well as into unpeace, unfreedom, disharmony, crime and into all possible terrible things, as you
 have done entirely since time immemorial, wherethrough you have brought death, depravity and destruction
 upon your humankind and world and also still today call forth everything within the same frame.

### #251 (Chapter 25)

 If you do kindle a blazing fire, then it shall be a fire of the knowledge, of the wisdom and of the truth in your-
 selves, a fire of the joy and of the love, of the fairness, responsibility, of the conscientiousness and righteous-
 ness, through which there will finally be true peace and also true freedom, harmony and equality in you and
 amongst you all, you humankind of Earth.

### #252 (Chapter 25)

 And to achieve all these high values, it only requires the energy and power of your volition, through which you
 yourselves are the master of your life and hold the determination of your foreordination in your hands; truly,
 your own energy and power of your consciousness, of your thoughts and feelings and of your own volition
 brings you into the highest heights, to the progress and to the consciousness-evolution, to the true love, to
 the inner and outer peace as well as to the freedom and harmony; therefore you create your reward and your
 punishment yourselves with inexorable certainty, depending on what thoughts and feelings you always nourish
 and what you complete with your works and deeds.

### #253 (Chapter 25)

 Be conscious that this knowledge leads you to the real truth and does not weaken your life, but rather
 strengthens it and builds it up.

### #254 (Chapter 25)

 The cognisance about the creational laws and recommendations and their modes of functioning can be used
 by you at any time, through which the life and all things of the existence, and the entirety of the creational
 appear far more sublime to you than before – if you have ever perceived this sublimity at all, in which edifying
 greatness is given.

### #255 (Chapter 25)

 And if you recognise the great sublimity of the Creation, its laws and recommendations and their truth of all
 truth, then you, you humankind of Earth, can no longer want any evil, because you then reach for the true
 love, the best support that exists for you ever; the miraculous Creation itself with all its created creations, its
 works, everything existent, is the love itself, and you shall follow suit, you humankind of Earth, and you shall
 also love your next ones, your fellow human beings and your whole humankind, in order to also bring the truth
 to all of them, so that they also may find the true love, the peace, the freedom and the harmony in themselves
 and in turn pass them on outwardly.
 
### #256 (Chapter 25)

 If you search for cognition and for the effective truth, then do not entangle yourselves in confused thoughts
 and feelings, as well as not in the irrational teachings of the garden of the irrational belief, in which the rot-
 ten fruit of the gods, tin gods and idolised human beings invented through people of your kind pollute every-
 thing.

### #257 (Chapter 25)

 Do not let yourselves be deceived through priests of belief and the like, who worship godheads and tin gods,
 as you shall also not fall prey to the deception with regard to idolised human beings.

### #258 (Chapter 25)

 Do not let yourselves be made irrational through the god-worshippers and do not assume that through an eternal
 law an atonement-coercion lies upon you that you cannot push from you nor transfer to someone else, because
 truthly there is no such atonement-coercion through an original sin or the like, because all such things only
 correspond to a senseless invention of people of your kind, you humankind of Earth.

### #259 (Chapter 25)

 Truth is, that there is no coercion for atonement, because everything that you load onto yourselves, you hold
 against yourselves, therefore you also in yourselves must stand up for it and give account for it, and indeed for
 all your thoughts and feelings and for your words; you are accountable only to yourselves for the thoughts and
 feelings you nourish and cherish and the false and evil words you speak or write; but you can also be account-
 able externally, if you do wrong deeds and works that bring disadvantage to others in any wise, through which
 you stand in their debt and you will be called to account by them or by the jurisdiction; however, you must
 never make atonement to a godhead or a tin god, because all of them are only fantasiful inventions through
 people of your kind, in which no energy and power is inherent and which in their insubstantiality and non-
 existence are not able to even change the colour of a single hair on your head.

### #260 (Chapter 25)

 What you therefore bring upon yourselves in terms of thoughts and feelings, vices, addictions, stinginess and
 envy, passions, bad character, unvirtues, lovelessness, jealousy and strife, inequity, irresponsibility, as well as un-
 righteousness, respectlessness, decencilessness and consciencelessness etc., no-one can solve, resolve and lead
 into the right lines except you yourselves; if it were otherwise, then the real truth of all truth would be merely
 an insignificance, and thus the whole Creation, the universal consciousness and universe, would collapse in
 itself, yes, the whole could not even have arisen and therefore could not have become existent.

### #261 (Chapter 25)

 As you yourselves are responsible for all and everything, you must free yourselves from all senseless belief-
 teachings, forget every imaginary godly coercion for atonement and set yourselves a culmination-point in the
 truthly truth, so that you, you humankind of Earth, strive only for this culmination-point and cast away and
 dissolve every belief.

### #262 (Chapter 25)

 If mere words are your truth, this avails you nothing, not even if you can recite long words and phrases word-
 for-word out of the memory and thus assume that you can therewith teach yourselves and your fellow human
 beings; truly all this doing avails you nothing if you have not found the real truth and do not act according to
 it, if you do not direct and arrange your thoughts and feelings and your whole earthly existence according to
 the effective truth; but if you do this, then it must be an implicitness for you, that has practically passed over
 into your flesh and blood and that cannot be separated from you any more; and only if this is so, will you be
 able to gain out of the eternal truth the values of the consciousness-evolution, of the true love, the peace, the
 freedom and harmony, and indeed in the wise how everything is given through the message of the truth that
 you bear in yourselves and how it is realised through the creational recommendations and laws.

### #263 (Chapter 25)

 You shall recognise yourselves by your own values, by your thoughts and feelings, by your deeds, by your activ -
 ities and by everything you do, to which your words and speeches that you make in the daily life of your earthly
 existence also belong; thus also your thoughts and feelings belong to your doing, which in their effects must
 not be underestimated, so you cannot think that thoughts and feelings are ‹duty free›, and in this regard you
 think that you cannot be brought to account for them, because they take place on a level that is unreachable
 through material hands and courts; but therein you delude yourselves in the wise, because you will be called
 to account for them sooner or later in yourselves.

### #264 (Chapter 25)

 If you, you humankind of Earth, nourish thoughts and feelings in an unconsiderate wise, then you unconsider -
 ately indulge in a dangerous game and in an unconsiderate delusion, that you can come forth out of it un-
 touched, but you are tremendously wrong in this, because your thoughts and feelings belong to your inner
 coarse-substantialness, therefore they also carry out their effects in yourselves, to which you must bow, and
 indeed whether you want to or not; this means however that the consequences of your own thoughts and
 feelings sooner or later demand accountability from you, therefore you must stand up for them in your own
 inner nature, because only therethrough can the consciousness raise itself up with regard to its evolution.

### #265 (Chapter 25)

 Search for the truth in your thoughts and let them also jointly swing in your feelings in such a wise that only
 everything noble awakens in you, so you do not sink into confusing lownesses and you do not imagine that
 no-one can perceive your thoughts and feelings.

### #266 (Chapter 25)

 Thoughts, feelings, words and external actions are equal to all coarse-substantialness of your consciousness and your body, but the thoughts and feelings have an effect into the levels of the fine coarse-substantial, the
words and speeches on the other hand in a middle coarse-substantial-realm, whereas the external deeds belong in the densest and coarsest coarse-substantial-level.

### #267 (Chapter 25)

 The three forms of the coarse-substance-levels of the thoughts and feelings as well as of the words, speeches
 and the deeds are closely connected with each other, therefore also their effects are intermeshing and have an
 incisive and determining effect on the developmental change of your life, which you, however, firstly are not
 capable of appraising and realising.

### #268 (Chapter 25)

 Truth is, that each conscious or unconscious thought and each thereout resulting feeling continue to be auto-
 matically active in their kind once they are created; in their middle coarse-substantialness they can strengthen
 themselves and thus become even more powerful forms than they were at their creation, and in this strength-
 ening they can continue to effect until coarse-substantial deeds result out of them, without you, you human-
 kind of Earth, being able to realise immediately that these are a result of your strengthened thoughts and
 feelings.

### #269 (Chapter 25)

 If you comprehend everything and become knowing in it, then you will be astonished about this in your
 thoughts and feelings because you will recognise the unconsiderateness and carelessness in your thought- and
 feeling-world, as well as the fact what might the thoughts and feelings have and what all in the good or evil
 can be negatively wrought or positively brought forth with them.

### #270 (Chapter 25)

 Through your thoughts and feelings alone, you humankind of Earth, you are involved in many good and bad
 actions of your fellow human beings without being conscious of it, because you do not strive for the cognition
 of the things and not for their truth, but go forth irresponsibly and unconcernedly in the life.

### #271 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, you, as humankind of Earth, are a we-form and as such are connected more or less with one another
 through your thoughts and feelings as well as through your subconsciousness, and as you nourish and cherish
 negative or positive thoughts and feelings, so they strengthen themselves once you call them forth, and in this
 strengthening they can strike any of your fellow human beings, through which they awake something resting
 in them that they bring to the coarse effect, although they had never previously thought about bringing it out
 and realising it; therefore you comprehensively bear the responsibility for your thoughts and feelings also for
 your fellow human beings, at least for those who are influenced through your mental and feeling-based impul-
 sations and thereout carry out corresponding deeds or call forth thoughts and feelings in themselves of the
 same kind.

### #272 (Chapter 25)

 So many of your fellow human beings very often have thoughts and feelings in them or carry out actions that
 in their origin lead back to you yourselves and that through the strengthening take effect in the others and call
 forth the corresponding reactions, which they then themselves reject and condemn, although they, like you,
 are also jointly responsible for them in accordance with the creational laws and recommendations, because
 they nonetheless act from out of themselves with the foreign thoughts and feelings that are striking them; and
 thus you can have thoughts and feelings for any things in you that you would never carry out into deeds etc.,
 however, your fellow human being who has been struck by your thoughts and feelings, and who is not able
 to work them out and bring them under control, does carry them out.

### #273 (Chapter 25)

 Consider such processes and search for the truth with regard to the effects of the thoughts and feelings, so
 that you learn to understand rightly and keep the hearth of your thoughts and feelings free and do not wreak
 terribleness, but rather create true love in you, as well as peace, freedom and harmony, and therefore high
 values that you shall carry forth through the swinging waves of your thought- and feeling-world to your fellow
 human beings and to the entire earthly humankind, so that war, hatred, jealousy, strife, inequity, disharmony,
 irresponsibility and consciencelessness come to an end as well as the unpeace, unfreedom, torture, the death
 penalty and all other terrible things with which you humankind of Earth are burdened.

### #274 (Chapter 25)

 You must therefore clean yourselves and become stable and strong in a good and positive wise in your
 thoughts and feelings, because only therethrough will the many crimes and unrighteousnesses as well as
 Ausartungen of all kinds happen less and decrease more and more, of which many amongst you are heavily
 co-guilty without you knowing it, because you do not care about it and also do not know the truth.

### #275 (Chapter 25)

 Consider, the swinging waves of your thoughts and feelings always impinge there, where they come upon
 equalities, therefore upon thoughts and feelings of the same or similar kind, in which case distance is of no
 significance, since the swinging waves are so fast that they hurry around the world in a fraction of a second
 and strike your fellow human beings at the farthest parts of Earth and bring about new effects in them.

### #276 (Chapter 25)

 So it is given that negative or positive thoughts and feelings from you individuals, you humankind of Earth, can
 bring about good or evil in all the world, by striking individual people of your kind, small or large groups or
 even whole peoples who are aligned to your thoughts and feelings; thus they can then forcibly trigger deeds
 and actions that are completely different in their forms to your mental and feeling-based impulsations, and yet
 nonetheless find their origin therein.

### #277 (Chapter 25)

 Since your thoughts and feelings swing out into the world and somewhere strike any of your fellow human beings, so you carry co-responsibility for their actions, and indeed both in the negative and in the positive; it
can also be that when carrying out deeds and actions, abominable things happen which you yourselves had
never thought of, the origin of their coming about, however, still leads back to your own thoughts and feelings;
truthly you are in constant connection with all your fellow human beings and their deeds and actions, whereas you yourselves are also struck by the returning effects of the thoughts, feelings, deeds and actions, which burden your consciousness and through which a building up of going in a circle results.

### #278 (Chapter 25)

 Due to the fact that amongst you, you humankind of Earth, a building up of going in a circle of your thoughts
 and feelings as well as your deeds and actions exists as a permanent connection, you must not only develop-
 mentally change towards the truth of all truth and follow the creational laws and recommendations as indivi-
 duals but as a whole humankind.

### #279 (Chapter 25)

 As individuals you can only be efficacious on a small scale and encourage people of your kind to the rationality
 so that they turn to the effective creational truth and to the following of the laws and recommendations, but
 in order to really let true love grow in the whole humankind, as well as peace, freedom and harmony, right-
 eousness, fairness and responsibility as well as conscientiousness and a clear following of the creational laws
 and recommendations, it is necessary that every single one amongst you, you humankind of Earth, gives ample
 consideration to the real truth and to all the high creational values and to the following of the laws and recom-
 mendations.

### #280 (Chapter 25)

 And truly, you, you humankind of Earth, can also contribute strongly as individuals to the love, peace, freedom
 and harmony and to the happiness of all humankind, even if you can be efficacious only on a small scale,
 because you can be glad and have pure and joyful thoughts for good deeds that others do and that unfold
 both near and far through their own as well as your good, healthy and positive thoughts and feelings, whose
 swinging waves they receive from you and which they evaluate to the good and positive; and from this, of
 which you shall be certain, streams everything equally and prosperously back to you again, even if you do not
 know it and if you do not consciously perceive it.

### #281 (Chapter 25)

 So you, you humankind of Earth, are entirely connected with each other, and as a developmental change to
 the good, to true love, freedom and harmony as well as to the peace amongst all of you shall be called forth
 and emerge, it is necessary that you altogether connect yourselves together in these high values through your
 thoughts and feelings, build them up in yourselves and jointly nourish and cherish them, since only through
 that can everything become truth and reality; so listen to those individuals amongst you who strive for it and
 do rightfully, and heed the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit and
 the teaching of the life, which is given through the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, so that you finally comprehend and
 follow the creational laws and recommendations and lead a life in delight and truth.

### #282 (Chapter 25)

 You must finally perceive and acknowledge the unmovable strength of character and of all virtues of the
 Creation and its laws and recommendations, because solely in their effects is everything given that leads to the
 truthly knowledge and the real truth, which gives you also wisdom and lets you become true human beings,
 so you become worthy of consciously receiving the great goodness, which the Creation gives you through your
 life and therewith also gives everything which is intended for your human consciousness. (In the "strength of
 character and of all virtues", everything is included: All high values such as love, peace, freedom harmony, posi-
 tive-negative-equalisedness and all virtues.)

### #283 (Chapter 25)

 And if you use everything rightfully that the Creation with its laws and recommendations has given you, then
 you will thankfully and in joy change everything in such a wise to the good and best, that you can pass it on
 to your fellow human beings and to all those created creations, which are capable of a good and positive deve-
 lopmental change through you human beings.

### #284 (Chapter 25)

 Do not remain cut off from all that which the Creation has given you for your life in the good and positive,
 also the energy and power of your consciousness, so that you use this in the sense of the evolution and do
 not suffer a decline in it; do not let yourselves sink deeper than you have already sunk, but strive for the real
 truth of all truth and fall away from your god-belief and from your belief in tin gods and idolised human
 beings, so that you go towards better times and a high-swinging humanhood.

### #285 (Chapter 25)

 Heed the truth as it is given to you in yourselves and in the creational laws and recommendations, and as it is
 also taught to you through the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, so that you find the vitality of the real truth and
 also experience it in yourselves.

### #286 (Chapter 25)

 Finding the truth is hard for you human beings of Earth, but it becomes continuously easier for you the more
 you get into it and win cognitions, knowledge as well as wisdom and thereout fulfilments, which make miracle
 over miracle of the creational goodness and beauty just as recognisable in you as they also make great miracles
 visible and accessible in the outer.

### #287 (Chapter 25)

 Be careful on the way to the truth, because if you go unattentively and do not heed and overcome all hin- drances and dangers that result out of the unrightness of your thoughts and feelings, then the might of that
starts to unfold which constrains you into very distinct forms of specific purposes that are based on your own
wishes, which fulfil themselves and shall thereby leave aside the truth; and truly this might and danger can
devour you, so you go down in it, if you tread the way of the truth unattentively – because consider, your old
goods of thoughts and your old feelings try again and again to break through to hinder the learning and fath -
oming as well as the following of the truth, because the time-immemorial belief-factors are of immense
strength and do not want to be pushed away or dissolved.

### #288 (Chapter 25)

 When searching for and fathoming the truth, guard yourselves against crampfully directing your thoughts and
 feelings in a fighting wise against the untruth of the time-immemorial and against the untruth of the religious,
 ideological and philosophical belief; fighting against the untruth does not mean to go in quarrelsomeness
 against it, rather taking up a defensive position in accordance with the gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit, so as to
 put everything untruthly and thus everything belief-based in its proper place; if however you do not act in this
 wise, then you force yourselves again into distinct lines and further your unfreedom as well as the unpeace
 and disharmony in yourselves, through which your striving becomes a ridiculous imposture and coercion and
 shows no lasting value, because truthly nothing is learnt and the great effect of a permanence never comes;
 fight-based strivings mean Gewalt and coercion, and such bring no advantage, but only great disadvantage,
 therefore you must refrain from them and turn to the free unfolding of the truth, and indeed in the wise, that
 you willingly and without aggression against the untruth extend your hand to the real truth and bring every-
 thing untruthly to a standstill by only accepting the truthly and the truth itself, if you have found it; only thus
 can you fight against the untruth without quarrelsomeness in gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit and win against it,
 so you go forth with the truth as victors in true greatness.

### #289 (Chapter 25)

 Think of the word of the truth that true greatness is uncomplicated and uncomplicatedness is true greatness,
 as well as uncomplicatedness is true simplicity and modesty, which you must nourish and cherish in your
 thoughts and feelings, so that you do not go overboard therein in one wise or another, through which you can
 no longer control them.

### #290 (Chapter 25)

 Consider that you cannot bring your thoughts and feelings into a real purity with a thought-volition alone,
 because the volition thereto must come forth and rise up simply and unrestrictedly out of your inner nature,
 and it cannot be put into words, because words can only very restrictedly let the whole arise in a term.

### #291 (Chapter 25)

 The all-embracing natural instinct to the good and to the best must come out of the core of your inner nature
 itself, so that that which gets mightfully into your thoughts and feelings and also enwraps them can arise, so
 that the natural instinct of the volition proceeds from out of it and takes that form which is that right thing
 which you need.

### #292 (Chapter 25)

 And know, that it is quite difficult to give enough consideration to the natural instinct of your inner nature, but it is not as very difficult as you think, if you let modesty and simplicity prevail over you, and if you do not
bring your rational and intellectual conceit and your overly boastful ability and your imagined power into play.

### #293 (Chapter 25)

 Let yourselves be free of your megalomaniacal thoughts and feelings as well as of the imagination that you
 would be greater than the Creation and absolute rulers of the life; let the core of your inner nature and its
 natural instinct for good, the best and higher break forth; let the noble and good in you be free, so you can
 create in yourselves a new foundation of your thought- and feeling-world that correspond to the capabilities
 of your consciousness; and if you act accordingly, then you can quietly leave what emerges out of it to the
 work of rationality and intellect as well as to the realisation in every right form, because in this wise nothing
 unright can form itself out of it.

### #294 (Chapter 25)

 Cast far from you all that which tortures you in your thoughts and feelings and trust thereby the intellect and
 the rationality; make the consciousness free, which will itself rightly open the way of the life and the way to
 the real truth and to the creational laws and recommendations, if you do not restrain yourselves against this
 and obstruct everything through an irrational brickwork of any belief in godheads, tin gods, religions, ideolo-
 gies, philosophies and idolised human beings.

### #295 (Chapter 25)

 To become free in your consciousness means that you shall let the consciousness in you go its evolutive way,
 because it is determined by nature and through the creational laws and recommendations, to go towards the
 height of the relative absolute full-development; you however, you humankind of Earth, are holding it back
 from this, because through wrong thought- and feeling-based as well as deed-based machinations you work
 against it and as a result put it in chains, through which it can no longer freely unfold itself.

### #296 (Chapter 25)

 Cleanse your thoughts and feelings, because they are the most important factors of your evolution and leading
 of life, and through them you must create a new humankind which comprehensively follows the creational
 laws and recommendations, and leads its life according to their truth, so that there will finally be true love
 amongst you human beings of Earth, so you can, in yourselves as individuals as well as groups and peoples,
 live in real freedom and harmony as well as in truthly peace.

### #297 (Chapter 25)

 And you must begin with your thoughts and feelings, so that you bring them under control, to the rationality
 and righteousness as well as to the fulfilment of the responsibility and to the conscientiousness and to the
 rightful in all things; this is the first task you have to master and which makes you slowly but surely to what
 you shall be, namely true human beings in dignity and humaneness.

### #298 (Chapter 25)

 You shall be a shining example for yourselves and for all your fellow human beings that strives ever further for
 truth and love.
 
### #299 (Chapter 25)

 And you shall be thankful for your life, and indeed through the whole kind of your existence as well as through
 the following of the Creation-given laws and recommendations, so that it may go well with you; and if you
 fulfil this duty, then you need no other guidance.

### #300 (Chapter 25)

 If you fulfil the duties of the life in this wise, as they are pre-given through the laws and recommendations of
 the Creation in the wise that you can carry them out and fulfil them according to your own intellect and your
 own rationality and according to your own choosing, then you will receive all helps of the existence, which
 await in creational laws and recommendations, so that you make them useful for you and thereby go upwards
 in your consciousness-evolution.
