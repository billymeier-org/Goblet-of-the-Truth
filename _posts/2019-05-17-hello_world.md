# Chapter 3
1) The prophets have brought you on Earth the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life as fulfilment of what preceded it through Nokodemion's teaching; and before this he himself taught
 his teaching to his peoples as a guideline (sign posting/leading thought) to distinguish between being fair and
 unfair, between right and unright and between truth and lie as well as between honesty and unhonesty and
 also between respect and slander (calumny).
2) And it is certain that those who deny the truth and the teaching of the prophets do not possess the Gewalt
 of forgiveness, so they cannot forgive those who do terrible things to them; the measure of forgiveness is only
 given to the fair ones (responsible ones) and the knowing ones who forgive those who do terrible things to
 them.
3) Truly, all life has been created through the laws of the wellspring of the truth (Creation), and therefore they are the same laws according to which you were created in your mother's womb after fertilisation (procreation).
4) And it is the prophets who have brought you the teaching about how these things happen and how you shall
 behave in your existence and how you shall be openly connected to it at all times, so that you do not bring
 suffering on yourselves and do not rob yourselves of the life.
5) The teaching of the prophets is of decisive importance for you and a guideline (sign-posting/leading thought)
 of the life, and therefore a foundation for leading the existence.
6) And the teaching of the prophets is not capable of different explanations because it is one teaching only and
 does not allow any misinterpretations; however, there are some amongst you who bear depravity in your
 thoughts and feelings, with the result that you think up from the teaching different explanations against the
 truth, because you want to lead into confusion and are looking for strained interpretations (falsifications and
 contradictions) in order to sow the seeds of discord and delusion; but none amongst you who are looking for
 ambiguity and untruth, and are spreading falseness and delusional guidance, none of you know the true expla-
 nation of the teaching, because the real truth of the knowledge of the teaching is known only by those who
 have based their knowledge on the truth of the laws and recommendations of the Creation.
7) Do not belong to those who deny and falsify the truth, because they will receive a poor reward and will suffer
 harm, since they are punishing themselves and are without true joy and friends.
8) And know that the teaching of the true prophets is based on the truth of the laws and recommendations of
 the Creation; and know that the teaching is only understood by those who willingly bring forward the
 understanding for it and who turn to the real truth.
9) Make sure that you comprehend and understand the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
 teaching of the life so that you will not become further depraved in yourselves, and will instead escape from
 your depravity.
10) See that you always guide yourselves rightly and be yourselves vouchsafers (guarantors/authenticators/obliga- tors) for all things that you shall do rightfully in order to lead your life in honesty and equitableness (fairness).
11) And you will certainly keep your promises that you make if you are fair ones (responsible ones) and ones know-
 ing of the truth and are without doubt in this; and if you also give a promise in front of your entire species of
 people of your kind (human species) as fair ones (responsible ones) and ones knowing of the truth, then the
 people will gather before you on the day when you give your promise, and the people will thank you and will
 give you its trust.
12) However, all of you who persist in being unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and ones who have no knowledge of
 the truth, you will gain no benefit from all your property and wealth when you are looking for true friendship,
 because only people of your kind (fellow human beings) will turn to you and your children.
13) You unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and ones without knowledge of the truth, you are the same as those who
 were unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and ones without knowledge of the truth before you and who con-
 demned the prophets' signs (evidence/marvels) and their teaching, for which they reaped inequity and harm,
 as will be the same on your way.
14) You unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unknowing ones in the truth who are chained to a belief in a god or tin gods, you are allowing yourselves to be overwhelmed by unright and by false teachings and lies so you col-
lect (store up) in yourselves everything that burns in a terrible state (condition) of the psyche and the inner
 world (consciousness) as the fire of the realm of the shadow world (realm of hell); and truly, this is a terrible
 state (condition) and is no place of rest in which good liberation (joy/gratification) and rest can be found in love
 and peace as well as in freedom and attunement (harmony).
15) Truly, the prophets have given you signs (evidence and marvels) so that you shall turn yourselves to the truth
 of the creative (Creation) and shall fight for the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
 of the life in a peaceful wise without weapons and through rationality and intellect with good words, so that
 love may grow all around you as well as peace and freedom and attunement (harmony).
16) And care for the sick and watch out for their healing, and offer consolation to those in mourning, and be help-
 ful to them in all things that they need.
17) Strengthen your support for all those who require it, so that they will also become strong and can give their
 support to others.
18) And open your senses to the teaching of the truth so that you will become knowing in it and be able to lead
 a life that fulfils the laws and recommendations of the creative (Creation).
19) Consider, your life is made beautiful through all the gifts of the creative (Creation), through all the things that
 you desire, through your women and men and children, through all the animals and other creatures, the plants
 and trees, through the entire appearance (nature) and the amassed piles of those uncountable things that
 bring you joy and pleasure; all of this is supplied for your existence by the creative (Creation) on Earth, which
 is your beautiful homestead in your life.
20) And there can be no better news for you than that you will have a comprehensively good existence if you fol- low the teaching of the prophets which is the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal raising
(Creation), and if you uphold love and peace amongst yourselves, as well as freedom and attunement (harmony).
21) For those who fear the unright and unknowledgeness, the vast garden of the truth is full of good and nourish- ing fruits, and the streams which flow through the garden are full of good and healing waters, and you shall
live in this garden in pleasure so that you live in love and peace and fulfil freedom and attunement (harmony).
22) And see, when you are present in the truth you will forgive the fallible ones and prevent yourselves from doing
 unright.
23) And if you are steadfast and truthful and obedient in following the teaching of the prophets, which is the
 teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal raising (Creation) then you will be free in your
 thoughts and feelings and will lead a praiseworthy life.
24) And know that the laws and recommendations of the primal raising (Creation) establish (confirm) that there is
 no primal raising (Creation) except for it, therefore there are neither gods nor tin gods, nor people of your kind
 (human beings) or liberators (angels) and demons who stand above it; and so know that those who possess
 the true knowledge about the real truth are the keepers of equitableness (fairness) whom you shall follow so
 that you too will be fair and connected to equitableness (fairness).
25) Truly, the true teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the life is the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the origin (Creation) as it is explained by the prophets; and only the truth-teaching brings
the acquiescence (forbearance) that the fulfilment of the life demands so that life may thrive and not wither.
26) Do not allow yourselves to become disunited in the teaching of the truth, and do not allow envy to come over
 you for its sake, because the teaching is indubitable, therefore it cannot be misconstrued (incorrectly explained)
 because it is given in clarity and cannot be twisted (falsified); and whoever denies or twists (falsifies) the truth
 of the teaching and its true explanation of the teaching is guilty of committing a lie and slander (calumny); and
 truly, whoever is guilty of committing a lie and slander (calumny) truly has no loyal friends who could keep him
 or her grounded in the face of misery.
27) If those who are traitors or turncoats (secessionists) or adversaries to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of
 the spirit, the teaching of the life dispute with you then do not surrender to them and do not follow them; if,
 however, you surrender to the traitors or turncoats (secessionists) or the adversaries to the teaching of the truth,
 then you will be badly led and brought onto the path of confusion so that you do not find the way of the truth
 and do not fulfil your duty of the present existence because you are following false messages and are also your-
 selves passing on (spreading) false messages.
28) Truly, the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and traitors, the turncoats (secessionists) and the adversaries who deny the signs (evidence) of the truth and with a false tongue (insult) twist it to their advantage, they are the
ones who are falsifying all signs (marvels) and the truth of the teaching of the prophets and the laws and
recommendations of the primal raising (Creation); and they are liars, as are also the scandalmongers and priests
who call on their god or tin gods and raise themselves to the status of their representatives (substitutes) and
who commit bloody deeds (murder) in their name and kill and pillage in other respects, just as they also defile
women and children or have such misdeeds conducted by their henchmen; and these unfair ones (irresponsi-
ble ones) are the ones who talk about the gods and tin gods that they have thought up (invented) in their
greed for might and their avarice and who preach love and equitableness (fairness) in their name whilst on the contrary demanding hatred and revenge and retaliation for everything if you oppose the fabulated (invented) will of the gods and tin gods, although in truth this is an opposition against the bondage of the priests and therefore against the servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because gods and tin gods are not real, but are mere fabulations (inventions) by those who obtain worldly gain from these lies.
29) All the deeds of the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) who set themselves over you as servants of gods and ser-
 vants of tin gods are naught, and you shall neither be a believer nor a helper of them because if you are then,
 like them, you will be far from the truth and far from the laws and recommendations of the primal raising
 (Creation) and therefore also servants of gods or servants of tin gods; however, if you are believers in gods or
 tin gods and in servants of gods or servants of tin gods, then you are acting in the unright like them and against
 the truth and the laws and recommendations of the primal raising (Creation) which are given in the regulation
 that you shall be yourselves and therefore that no might shall stand over you which you are obliged to follow,
 except for yourselves in your own responsibility for all things which you approach and which you perform.
30) And if you have cognisance of the truth-teaching of the prophets, and if you follow the teaching of the laws
 and recommendations of the primal raising (Creation), then you shall be called upon to lead your life in accor-
 dance with the guideline (law and recommendation/sign-posting/leading thought); and therefore in cognisan-
 ce of the truth-teaching, you shall call on yourselves to decide (determine) rightfully between good and evil
 and between right and unright, because you yourselves shall be truth and not turn away from it in unwilling-
 ness.
31) The fire of the untruth shall not touch you, not even for a limited number of days; do not be accustomed to
 falsifying the truth yourselves, so that you may not be deceived in your knowledge about the truth.
32) If you gather on a day and in a place in order to listen to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
 the teaching of the life, then make sure that there is no doubt in you, so that you merit in honourableness the
 knowledge and wisdom and equitableness (fairness) which is given to you so that you do not suffer any unright
 in your knowledge about the truth.
33) Pass on your knowledge of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal raising (Creation) and
 the teaching of the prophets, to whom you want, and take the truth and the teaching from anyone, from
 whom you want, but do not set yourselves above others with it so that you do not debase them; take every-
 thing that is good and everything that is truthful, then you will have might over all things in you.
34) And do not allow either day or night to pass without you learning and without turning yourselves to the truth
 of the primal raising (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, because everything living comes forth from
 the truth of the primal raising (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, just as from the living the lifeless
 comes, from which, in turn, new life emerges.
35) And pay attention to what and how you pass on the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
 teaching of the life in truliness, so that no misunderstanding may arise and no ambiguity may come forth; and
 pass on the teaching of the prophets to whomever you want, and do it without measure but only ever if you
 are asked to do so, so that you and the teaching may not be unwanted and do not create vexation.
36) Believers in a god or tin gods as well as those who are unknowing ones in the truth and unfair ones (irrespon-
 sible ones) may be your friends because they are basically people of your kind (human being) as you are and
 you shall respect them as such, but do not copy them in their unknowledge, in their inequity (unfairness) and
 in their serving gods and serving tin gods so that you may be free from this and will not enter into any con-
 nection with their doings; gird yourselves with caution for the doings of your friends who are unfair ones (irre-
 sponsible ones) and unknowing ones and believers in gods and tin gods, because they are passing by the truth
 and are thinking of leading you into their delusion if you allow yourselves to be misled by them; therefore be
 warned and only act rightfully, as you are told (recommended) by the real truth of the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
37) If you conceal some untruth or dishonourableness that is in your inner world (consciousness), or if you make
 it known, then be certain (knowing) that you cannot keep it secret for a long time because untruthfulness and
 dishonourableness will come to the light of the truth at their time, therefore you shall not lie or do honourless
 things so that you may always have might over your words of the truth and honourableness.
38) If you have fallen prey to the untruth and dishonourableness, then consider the day when you will be gath-
 ered by others and convicted of lying and dishonour, and it is held against you that instead of doing good and
 fair (responsible) things you only did evil and unfair (irresponsible) things; and when this day comes, you will
 wish that there was a great gap between the day of giving account and your unfair (irresponsible) and evil
 doings; therefore be warned against your own shame, even if others are benevolent and kind to you.
39) If you love the truth of the laws and recommendations of the origination (Creation), then follow it and it is cer- tain that you will be respected and loved by all those to whom you do good from this truth; but if there are
bad ones amongst them who are unknowing in the truth and are unfair and will therefore do evil to you, then
forgive them their faults because as unknowing ones and unfair ones (irresponsible ones) they do not know
what they are doing.
40) That one amongst you who chooses the real truth is the only one to walk the way of equitableness (fairness)
 and respect for life, and not to act against the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of wisdom
 (Creation).
41) Be loyal to the truth and promise it to be true to it, and dedicate your obligation to it alone in the sense of ful-
 filling life that is given in the swelling (evolution) of the inner world (consciousness) and of the spirit.
42) Obey your own rationality and do not allow yourselves to be misled by irrational ones and unfair ones (irre-
 sponsible ones) so that you will not suffer any harm in the exercise of your rationality, through your thoughts
 and feelings or your deeds and wishes.
43) Be at all times fair and honest and consider that you are all related and connected to one another as created
 creations (life forms) and inhabitants of your world.
44) And as you are all born from your mothers' wombs, so you are all born from the womb of the wellspring of
 wisdom (Creation) so that you may be dedicated to life and may truly lead it in equitableness (fairness) and
 respect.
45) And as you are born from the womb of your mothers so your children will also be born from the womb of
 their mothers; and it shall be that you treat them honourably whether they are female or male, because each
 created sex is worthy of the life in honour, in equitableness (fairness) and in dignity, therefore no distinction is
 to be made by you between children of female or male gender.
46) And be certain (knowing) that no child shall be preferred before another and appointed (esteemed/valued)
 more than another one; and therefore a female child is of no greater worth than a male child, and a male child
 is of no greater worth than a female one, instead it shall be that offspring of either sex are included into the
 same rights and the same freedom as well as the same honour and dignity.
47) And consider that when children come forth from the womb of a mother, that you are responsible for their
 thriving and their provision and that they are instructed (taught) rightfully in all things of the preparation (edu-
 cation) and in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life; and you shall also
 be responsible for instructing your offspring in the influences (factors/effects) of dying and of death as it is
 explained in the teaching of the life; and if a woman is pregnant then she shall carry the growing life in honour
 and dignity so that its forming will be completed in its time and born; and if it is given that the fruit of the
 womb endangers the life of the pregnant woman or if it is given that the fruit of the womb is demonstrably
 terribly deformed or incapable of life then it shall be that the unborn life is interrupted in its development and
 aborted; and women shall not be reproached for this, because this doing is rightful providing the reason (pre-
 condition) is given for it; do not heed the delusional teachings of false wise people and false prophets, neither
 those of priests or other servants of gods and servants of tin gods and truth-distorters who instruct (teach)
 other things and spread teachings that are lies.
48) Always be kind and patient with your offspring and instruct (teach) them the real truth in all things, because
 they are the ones who will steer the situation of the world after you, therefore tell them what they shall do
 rightfully and in equitableness (fairness), as you instruct (teach) them; allow your offspring to grow up in well-
 disposed growth, the female and the male, and be good caretakers (guardians) and benefactors to them in all
 things so that they may become true people of your kind (human beings) in all respects (regards).
49) And pay heed that, if you desire children, you do not make them into believers in gods and tin gods and that
 priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods do not lead them astray into submissiveness, be-
 cause your offspring shall be free in their thoughts and feelings, as well as in their determinations (decisions)
 and their deeds in all things; and pay heed that belief and submissiveness fight against and suppress (prevent)
 your own determinations (decisions) and own deeds in your own responsibility, resulting in a subjection (sub-
 ordination/dependency/subjugation/servitude).
50) Do not heed those who bring delusional teachings, who pray to gods and tin gods and pay homage to them
 (glorify them) in cults and rituals and who set themselves up above you in their hazy picture (delusion) of their
 belief as priests and the like, and they heat up their desire in your masses (bathe in the mass of people, take
 a bath and let themselves be celebrated, glorified, cheered and praised) when you are gathered around them;
 do not pay heed to them because they are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and self-righteous ones (vain
 ones/arrogant ones/falsely pious ones) who let themselves appear brilliant before you and deceive you with
 their belief and falsify the truth for you.
51) Do not call on any gods or any tin gods, any liberators (angels) and demons, neither on any people of your kind (human beings) in the belief that they might be equivalent to the wellspring of the love (Creation), because
in truth they cannot be this, since gods and tin gods as well as liberators (angels) and demons and false miracles
(absurdities) are only fabulations (inventions) created by people of your kind (human beings) and powerless hal-
lucinations (delusional constructions) and phantasms of your brain; therefore do not search for signs (evidence)
and miracles (outstanding things) in them, neither good news, because they cannot give them being incapable
of doing this, because truly, signs (marvels) of the truth can only be given by those who are capable of confirm- ing the true strength of the wellspring of the love (Creation) in respect and equitableness (fairness) through the strength of their inner world (consciousness); and only those who have knowledge of the truth, the right- eous ones (conscientious ones), and especially (in particular) the true prophets can confirm the truth and the signs (marvels) and the words.
52) Therefore do not debase yourselves before gods and tin gods, neither before liberators (angels) and venerable
 ones (holy ones) and demons, nor before people of your kind (human beings) because it is not seemly for you
 to debase yourselves before them and pray to them; and if you want to make a prayer, then pray to your inner
 world (consciousness) because it is this which realises out of its might what you ask of it and create through
 your own power; however, no material things can be achieved by your inner world (consciousness), but only
 all that which you are able to create through your might of your inner world (consciousness) and your thoughts
 and feelings; therefore be obedient to the truth and do not debase yourselves in order to beg things from
 mights that are powerless or have no presence (are inexistent).
53) The truth shall grow in each of you and bear fruit so that when you have advanced in years you will go hand
 in hand with knowledge and wisdom and fruitfully instruct (teach) those who are still unknowing and who
 need the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
54) Do not ask the prophets to give signs (marvels) and miracles (outstanding things) as proof of their truth-
 teaching, because their honest word and their true teaching shall be sufficient evidence for you.
55) And be certain (knowing) that if you allow the true words of the teaching of the prophets to penetrate into
 you and if you yourselves think about it and search for the truth in yourselves, then you will also find the proof
 of the truth in yourselves; and if you do the same then you will cleanse yourselves in your inner world (con-
 sciousness) and in the understanding of the truth so that you will surely elevate yourselves to be the ones
 knowing of the truth and fair ones (responsible ones).
56) The announcement of the prophets, their teaching of the truth, their teaching of the spirit, their teaching of
 the life, is not an announcement of the unseen (unconscious), because the teaching is based on the laws and
 recommendations that are visible in everything and come from the wellspring of the love (Creation) which re-
 veals everything unremittingly; you however shall make yourselves capable of recognising the laws and recom-
 mendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) in you and in the appearance (nature) and in all things so
 that you become all-knowing and recognise and follow the truth.
57) Recognise the truth in yourselves alone, because you are only able to find it in yourselves and not however in
 fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, in liberators (angels) and venerable ones (holy ones) and demons, and
 not either amongst those who lead you into confusion as priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods
 as well as false prophets; do not listen to those who quarrel with one another regarding their sanctimonious-
 ness and their delusional teachings and who lead the believers in their gods and tin gods into battles (wars)
 and command punishment and hatred and revenge as well as the spilling of blood and destruction in order to
 impose servitude (bondage) and their beliefs on those who believe otherwise.
58) Listen to the good tidings of each word of your true prophets, and be honoured to be allowed to receive the
 words and the tidings of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life through
 the prophets, so that you yourselves also go out into the world and bring the words and the tidings of the
 truth to all those who want to hear it and make it their own.
59) And teach your children the truth-teaching whilst they are still in the cradle, and continue to teach them until
 they come of age (grow up) so that they may also teach their descendants if they beget them and bring them
 into the world; act so that you and your descendants are righteous ones (conscientious ones) and are knowing
 ones in the truth and fair ones (responsible ones).
60) And if you say a prayer in truliness to your inner world (consciousness) for something to come about that you
 rightfully wish for yourselves and you do everything so that it may come about, then it will do so.
61) And if you speak to your inner world (consciousness) in prayer, then make sure that your words are not bab- bling, but are spoken in rationality because it is not your babbling but instead your intellect and your rationality
which create might in the inner world (consciousness) from which what you are asking for becomes reality.
62) And heed the prophets who sent themselves out to you and send themselves out to you in order to bring you the
 signs (marvels) and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, so that you
 may become knowing in the truth about the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) which
 you shall follow.
63) And the prophets come to teach you about what was before you and what will come after you; and they pro-
 claim to you what you shall eat and drink and what you shall store up in your houses so that you do not have
 to suffer from hunger or thirst in times when food is scarce.
64) And the prophets come to proclaim to you what the prophets taught and brought before them of the teach - ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life; and they come to allow you what has been
prohibited (forbidden) by false prophets and servants of gods, as well as by servants of tin gods and priests
through delusional teachings; and the true prophets come with the signs (marvels) and words of the truth so that you may be liberated from senseless laws and directions that have been fabulated (invented) and imposed on you by priests and servants of tin gods and servants of gods; do not obey the senseless laws and directions made up (invented) by people of your kind (human beings) which are oriented towards a belief in gods and tin gods, because in truth they only serve to keep you in submissiveness and in servitude (bondage) held under the spell of a belief in gods and tin gods.
65) Escape from unknowledge and turn yourselves to the knowledge of the truth so that you may become helpers
 in the matter of the truth and that you may confirm the fact that it alone brings prosperousness and true love
 and peace.
66) And truly, let only the truth be your companion and the power of guidance through your present existence.
67) Follow the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) at all times, as they have been taught
 to you by the prophets so that you can name yourselves confirmers of the truth and of the teaching of the
 truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
68) And plan your lives through the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), and
 follow your plan so that you do the same as the primal power (Creation) because it also planned and followed
 its plan by creating the firmaments (universe) and earths (worlds/planets) and all life and let it become truth;
 therefore you shall do the same as the primal power (Creation) and plan everything and let it become reality
 which is of goodness and of unfolding (progress) so that you may be the best planners who have proceeded
 from the planning (idea) of the primal power (Creation).
69) And consider that you shall always die a natural death and shall never presume to end your life yourselves, so that you do not besmirch your will in freedom and do not bring dishonour and dignitylessness down on yourselves.
70) And do not allow yourselves to be confused by taunts (insults) and lies from those who maintain through lies
 and deception and chickenheartedness (cowardice), and therefore through unknowledgeness, that it is right-
 ful to lay a hand on one's own life in order to deliver it ignominiously over to death.
71) And do not disregard this recommendation so that you do not follow in the footsteps of those who have dis-
 regarded it and persist in unknowledge about the truth and make themselves guilty of the bloody deed (mur-
 der) on themselves.
72) Regarding the unknowledgeness that is directed against the truth-teaching of the proclaimers, the prophets,
 and therefore against the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), it is taught to you that
 you are punishing yourselves if you disdain the truth and accommodate unknowledgeness and help its ad-
 vancement (furtherance), because truly your guilt will bring a punishment in yourselves because you have fallen
 prey to lovelessness and unpeace.
73) As far as those of you are concerned who are knowing in the truth and do good deeds and do not commit
 any outrages, you will receive full reward for this through true love and esteem, and therefore joy and peace
 and harmony and freedom will be in you.
74) And what the prophets announce (teach) in these things are signs (evidence) of the laws and recommenda-
 tions of the Creation, and so may everything be wise admonishment.
75) And what the teaching of the prophets brings is the truth of all truth, and therefore there is no doubt in it,
 because it is the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the Creation so that you may follow it.
76) And truly, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life is broad and large in its
 dimension, therefore it never comes to an end and always continues through new insight (cognition) and clear-
 sightedness, as well as through new recognition and understanding.
77) But whoever now disputes the truth regarding what has been given to you in knowledge and wisdom of the
 teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, that human being fervently suggests
 himself or herself as a liar.
78) And truly, only the truth of the primal power (Creation) has validity through its laws and recommendations,
 and only the teaching of its truth is a truthly message and explanation; and therefore only the primal power
 (Creation) is the truthly one for you to confer respect and dignity, because it alone is in goodness and love and
 wisdom the sole might in the firmaments (universe) and on the earths (worlds/planets); and just as respect and
 dignity shall be paid to the primal power (Creation), nothing of the same or in the same wise shall be paid to
 all the fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, and neither to the people of your kind (human beings), nor to
 liberators (angels) and demons, venerable ones (holy ones), priests and the like who are only servants of gods
 and servants of tin gods, because truly they are not worthy of worship which is what they all crave; the primal
 power (Creation) does not demand worship, because worship is only a confused and bad work of people of
 your kind (work of human beings) which leads to submissiveness and unfreedom and to servitude (bondage);
 if you do say a prayer, then do not do so in worship, which is dignityless supplication and begging without
 honour and calling for magic rituals, and is not the same as praying which is a directed call for something
 valueful and perceptions to arise from the inner world (consciousness) so that everything shall come about
 through your own might in order to serve progress (evolution).
 79) If you turn yourselves away from the truth, then consider that you will be overwhelmed by those causing ter-
  ribleness.
 80) You who have knowledge and you who have no knowledge of the truth of the laws and recommendations of
  the primal power (Creation), come by at all times for a word which is at the same level between you and the
  prophets, so that you may hear their teaching and may ask them about its sense; and so that you learn not to
  pray to any gods and tin gods, neither any priests nor other servants of tin gods and servants of gods, libera-
  tors (angels), demons and venerable ones (holy ones); and so that you learn not to place people of your kind
  beside the primal power (Creation), and so that there are none amongst you who are spreading a false teach-
  ing and giving false witness (false oath) or killing in Ausartung.
 81) Be at all times discerning in your thoughts and live only according to the guideline (sign-posting/leading
  thought) of the truth, so that it may go well with you through this and you can bear witness to this.
 82) Do not guarrel over the teaching of the truth that has already been given to you since time immemorial, be-
  cause it is always the same teaching that was given to you by the prophets from the line of Nokodemion,
  therefore everything that has been disclosed to you is the same, although always in new words according to
  your understanding; do you not want to comprehend this?
 83) See now! You are the ones who since time immemorial have always disputed what you have received in cog-
  nicance of the teaching of the truth through the prophets, and it is you who are disputing something of which
  you have no cognisance whatsoever and what is hidden from you, about which you also know nothing.
 84) Do not be believers in any of the gods or tin gods, and do not be believers in any priests or other servants of
  gods or servants of tin gods, and do not be believers in liberators (angels) and demons and venerable ones
  (holy ones), but instead be connected to the truth of the laws and recommendations of the formation
  (Creation) and be obedient to it, so that you may not be amongst those who place gods and tin gods as well
  as priests and other servants of tin gods and servants of gods and liberators (angels) and venerable ones (holy
  ones) beside the truthly formation (Creation).
 85) And truly, those amongst you who are closest to the teaching of the prophets are you who follow the truth-
  teaching and who are knowing ones and fair ones (responsible ones), and you who honour and protect the
  true prophets who are true fathers to you in love.
 86) One part of the people would like to lead you into confusion about the teaching of the truth, because they
  are believers in fabulated (invented) cults and gods and tin gods, as well as in demons and liberators (angels),
  priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of tin gods and godheads, as well as in venerable ones (holy ones)
  who are all merely the hallucinations (delusional constructions) of those who are leading (guiding) themselves
  into confusion, but they also lead you into confusion and exploit and subjugate you; it is just that you do not
  want to comprehend this truth.
 87) Because you do not want to comprehend the truth, you deny the signs (evidence) of the truth and the teaching
  of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life that has been brought to you by the prophets,
  and all this despite you being bystanders (witnesses) of the signs (evidence) and the teaching of the prophets
  and the laws and recommendations of the formation (Creation) and of the appearance (nature).
 88) Do not mix truth and falseness together, neither good nor evil, and do not knowingly (consciously) dissimulate
  (conceal/falsify/deny) the truth.
 89) And do not be of the behaviour that, during the first half of the day, you turn to the truth and to everything
  that it discloses, after which you subsequently deny everything and hope that the ones who are knowing of
  the truth may perhaps return to your unknowledge and to your inequity (unfairness).
 90) And only follow the one who follows the truth, because true leadership (guidance) is only found in it; and the truth
  is also found in that you shall give as is given to you provided that it is of the truth and goodness; however, you
  shall not repay measure for measure if it concerns falseness, lying, vilification (insult), slander (calumny) and
  terrible things and evil; if you do not follow this recommendation then discord, hatred and strife cannot be
  avoided.
 91) Decide to conduct yourselves with respect and benevolence (humanity) towards people of your kind (human
  beings), and always have endless grace (esteem, compassion, benevolence, love, mildness) for them.
 92) If a treasure (goods and chattels, possessions, fortune, etc.) is entrusted to you, then give it back in the same
  measure as you received it; do not be unfair ones (irresponsible ones) to whom a treasure (goods and chattels,
  possessions, fortune, etc.) is entrusted and then it is not returned to the full extent or not at all; and do not
  be unfair ones (irresponsible ones) in that you receive an advance (loan) or an accommodation (short-term
  loan) and it is given back only if the receiver of the advance (debtor) or the receiver of the accommodation
  (debtor) has been continuously chased after or following recourse to jurisdiction.
 93) Consider the untaught ones, the unknowing ones and the unfair ones (irresponsible ones), because you also
  have an obligation towards them to be helpful to them in good things and to instruct (teach) them in the truth-
  teaching, even though they speak out in lies and slanders (calumnies) and vilifications against the truth and
  the teaching of the truth of the prophets.
  94) And if you fulfil all your obligations and fear (refuse/reject) the unfair (irresponsible) and the untruth, then you
   will be able in honesty to enjoy your own well-being
  95) Those who accept a miserable measure (price) in exchange for the bond with the truth of the Creation and its
   laws and recommendations, and take oaths against the truth, they will have no true part in existence, becau-
   se they are unfree in themselves and loveless towards themselves, and therefore they are lacking inner free-
   dom, peace and consonance (harmony); therefore, however, the honest ones and fair ones (responsible ones)
   and those who are knowing of the truth will not be connected to them in friendship so they are awaiting their
   own painful punishment; but if they clean themselves from their disasters, then they may be certain (knowing)
   that the upright ones and fair ones (responsible ones) and those who are knowing of the truth will be connec-
   ted to them in respectful (honourable) friendship.
  96) Truly, there are many amongst you who twist your tongues (are hypocritical) so that you others believe, that
   they were talking about the truth-teaching, although their words are not from the teaching; they are lying and
   claiming that what they are saying has been taught by the prophets, but they are only expressing lies against
   the prophets and they know it.
  97) Considering that the prophets have given you the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
   of the life, it is not seemly for you to twist (falsify) their words when teaching it so that people of your kind
   (fellow human beings) may be your servants (hands/helpers) and be subservient to you; be at all times fair and
   teach the teaching as it has been given to you by the prophets, and make sure that the people of your kind
   (human beings) do not bow down (fall in bondage) to you and do not become your zealots (fanatics), but are
   loyally connected to the truth-teaching and the Creation.
  98) It is not possible for the prophets to demand (command) you to accept the truth-teaching and follow it, be-
   cause you must determine (decide) for yourselves whether you want to be connected to the teaching or not;
   if the prophets were to command you then they would be the same as the rulers who impose coercion on their
   subjects and subjugate them when you have given yourselves up to their Gewalt.
  99) And think of the bond that the prophets made with themselves in times of yore, so that you shall receive
   instruction (teaching) and guidance in the truth-teaching through them, which is why they have brought the
   teaching of the knowledge and the wisdom to you up to the present day in order to fulfil their bond that they
   made with themselves so that you would be knowing in the truth and help yourselves to reach truliness (pure-
   ness as a true human being); and think of the bond that the prophets entered in themselves with you, with
   you the people so that you would become fruitful through your understanding of the truth and would form
   your inner world (consciousness) in such a wise as to turn yourselves to love and peace as well as to knowl-
   edge and wisdom so that true peace prevails in you and amongst you.
  100) To enable everything to arise in you which is of great value and brings you unfolding (evolution) in your inner
   world (consciousness) and in the thoughts and feelings as well as in your psyche, and also that all your virtues
   may prosper, you have to agree to create all the great values in yourselves, which can only happen if you per-
   ceive your responsibility to its full extent; and as you agree and turn yourselves to your nobleness (virtues) and
   fulfil it in all forms, then you confirm the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the
   life as has been brought to you by the prophets.
  101) Whoever turns to the truth-teaching and then turns away from it again, for whatever reason this may be, that
   human being is committing an outrage against himself or herself, because he or she will be turning to a delu-
   sional teaching of falseness.
  102) And whoever turns away from the truth-teaching, which is the teaching of teh true knowledge and the wisdom,
   will search for a teaching of belief that is bound to gods and tin gods and their priests and other servants of
   gods and servants of tin gods; and they will be willing to follow the false teaching in order to return to those
   from whom they came before they turned in doubt to the teaching of the prophets to which they were how-
   ever once again disloyal, because they do not understand the truth and are full of suspicion and discord, as
   well as being full of two-partedness (doubt) and without relation.
  103) Know about the truth of the creative (Creation) and about the teaching of the truth as has been revealed since
   time immemorial up to the present day by the prophets and as was revealed to your forefathers and their fore-
   fathers and to all the people; and know that since time immemorial the prophets have not differentiated be -
   tween those whom they have instructed (taught) therefore they did not display any conceit (arrogance/haughti-
   ness/boastfulness) or any hatred against believers in tin gods and gods and their priests and servants, and
   therefore neither against any other skin colour or kinds (races); and therefore the prophets never demanded
   that those whom they were instructing in the truth-teaching shall have to submit themselves to the teaching,
   because turning to it always has been and always will be a matter of one's own freedom.
  104) How shall a people (state) be taught in a fair (responsible) wise if it itself and its authority are unfair (irrespon- sible) and unversed in the real truth and the wisdom and therefore in the teaching of the truth, the teaching
  of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because unfair (irresponsible) authorities make for themselves unfair (inad-
  missible/biased) laws and instructions and directives (ordinances/regulations) by means of which the people's
  freedom is held down (reduced/curtailed/constrained); and unfairly taught authorities impose unfair (dispro- portionate) charges (taxes) on the people in order to exploit the people in irresponsibleness so that the higher ones may skim off their expenditure (spending) imposed in falseness and irresponsibility at the expense of the people, because they spend more than they receive in fair (proportionate) charges (taxes) since they cannot redeem (draw up) an allocation plan (budget) in their incapability; therefore the higher ones burden the people with more and more senseless charges (taxes) that serve to exploit and limit the people's freedom, against which the people in its indolence (unconcernedness) does not take any countermeasure, so as a result the authori- ties fall prey to ever greater audacity in their exploitation by charges (taxes); therefore it shall be given that the people, rather than authority, shall decide on the necessary charges (taxes) and an allocation plan and for all necessities, and for this purpose the people shall be advised by experts in the matter to be decided, so that the people (state) may not fall into obligation (debt/over-indebtedness).
  105) And in order to achieve fair (responsibility-conscious) authorities which guide the people in a fair (responsible)
   wise, handling their affairs and desires and requirements in a fair (responsible) wise, then it can only be that
   the higher ones may not raise themselves up to their area (office/position/post), but are appointed by election
   (voting) in which case the majority of the votes is decisive; it may be however, that the candidates for an area
   (office/position/post) in authority are strictly checked (proved) so that only such human beings are appointed
   to a task who are capable of fulfilling them equitably and in honesty and equitableness (fairness) and without
   demanding (desiring) personal advantages; and each human being who is called into an area (office/position/
   post) of authority shall be remunerated by the people (state) in a fair (proportionate) wise, and not in an exag-
   gerated remuneration, and therefore without special rights and claims as well as without special concession
   (authority) and special rights (privileges), so that he or she may be ranked equally to any other fair one (respons-
   ible one) of the people, so that there may be no position of presumption (superiority/elevation) for the leaders
   compared to the people; in truth, in all rights all people of your kind (human beings) as people of your kind
   (human beings) are equal and one is not worth any more than another, therefore there may be no difference
   between the leaders and the people, and also not between rich and poor, not between those who are know-
   ing and unknowing, not between those who are educated and uneducated, not between fair ones (respons-
   ible ones) and unfair ones (irresponsible ones), and neither between believers and those who are knowing of
   the truth or between kinds (races) and skin colours and peoples.
  106) How shall the true prophets teach the people, irrespective of whether the people is knowing or unknowing in
   the truth-teaching, if the people does not confirm that it wants to be taught by them?; and how shall the true
   prophets teach the authority, irrespective of whether the higher ones are knowing or unknowing in the truth-
   teaching, if they do not confirm that they want to be taught by them?; in truth, the true prophets can only
   teach those who confirm that they want to be taught – whether they are ones knowing of the truth or ones
   unknowing of the truth.
  107) And truly, do not open your ears to those who lie to you saying that you will be cursed if you do not believe
   in gods and tin gods or in liberators (angels) and demons and venerable ones (holy ones), because all of them
   are only unsubstantial fabulations (inventions) of those who are confused and of all those who want to beat
   you down into servitude (bondage) and exploit you through your belief; and therefore their lies are also hazy
   pictures (delusions), as are shared by their believers and the priests of gods and tin gods and of other servants
   of gods and servants of tin gods; and do not open your ears to those who lie to you that you will be cursed if
   you do not believe in priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of delusional beliefs and gods and tin gods,
   and also if you do not believe in people of your kind (human beings) who raised themselves up as godheads
   or as authorised ones (substitutes) of gods and tin gods and demons.
  108) Pay heed to only dwelling amongst those who are connected to the truth, but not amongst the deniers of the
   truth, so that you shall not become like them and that you do not create punishment in yourselves through
   lovelessness and unpeace and unknowledgeness; and do not give yourselves any deferment (time limit) for
   remaining amongst deniers of the truth if they confront you threateningly (intimidatingly/dangerously) so that
   you shall subserviently bow down (in bondage) to their lies about the truth.
  109) It shall not be held against you as unright if you dwell amongst deniers of the truth or consort with them
   providing you do not let yourselves be made uncertain in your love for the truth.
  110) Truly, if you dwell amidst deniers of the truth or consort with those who were previously knowing of the truth
   and fell away from it, then keep (protect) yourselves in particular from their fickleness (change of mind), be-
   cause they are seven times more slanderous (calumnious) in their denial of the truth than those who have never
   been connected to the truth-teaching before.
  111) And truly, those who have fallen away from the truth after previously having been connected to it and who
   continue to wallow in unknowledgeness of the truth, they will not rue this quickly, but will be confused for a
   long time and will always be concerned to slander (calumniate) those who are knowing in the truth and to
   make them turn away from their love of the truth.
   112) As for those who are unknowing in the truth and the truth-teaching of the prophets, you shall not accept ei-
    ther gold or other values from them if they, in their wanting to buy themselves free from the bad of their
    unknowledge, are giving it as ransom; truly, it is not possible to free oneself from the bad and pangs of con-
    science, from vices and lapses by performing penitence (atonement) and by making a penitential payment
    (indulgence/fine/ransom), because liberation from this can only come about through an elimination (no repe-
    tition) of the fallibilities (errors) and, if necessary, by an appropriate fulfilment of guidelines; if priests and other
    servants of tin gods and servants of gods accept penitence (atonement) and a penitential payment (indul-
    gence/fine/ransom) then they are doing not right and are only interested in robbing their believers, because
    they cannot guarantee forgiveness for the bad and guilt or for vice and lapses either through penitence (atone-
    ment) or through a penitential payment (indulgence/fine/ransom), because forgiveness can only be granted by
    those who committed the bad and lapses themselves and have loaded the guilt or vice on themselves, as well
    as by those who had to suffer under them.
   113) You can only achieve righteousness (conscientiousness) if you are fair ones (responsible ones) and knowing
    ones and fulfillers of the truth and of the laws and recommendations of the Creation; and you are also fair
    ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones) if you give to the poor and needy from that
    which is dear to you.
   114) And truly, all food and all drink is permitted to you, with the exception of that which is adverse to your well-
    being, because it is inedible or undrinkable due to being dangerous and deadly.
   115) And as you want to be fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones), abide by the teach-
    ing of the prophets so that you follow their words and are truthful in following the truth and the laws and
    recommendations of the Creation.
   116) However, those amongst you who fabulate (invent) lies and slanders (calumnies) against the prophets and their
    teaching and against the truth and against the laws and recommendations of the Creation, you are commit-
    ting an outrage against all irrefutability (rightness/reality/flawlessness/authenticity/truthfulness) of the inner
    world of the firmaments (universal consciousness).
   117) The prophets have spoken the truth since time immemorial, therefore follow their teaching, their explanations
    and words, so that you are connected to the truth, as the prophets are connected to you, and next to them
    you shall not have any false prophets and not lend them your ear.
   118) And the teaching of the true prophets is the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
    the life, originating out of the laws and recommendations of the Creation and of the appearance (nature) cre-
    ated by it, and it is overabundant in boons (prosperousness/fullness/fruitfulness, etc.) as a guideline (sign-
    posting/leading thought) for all peoples.
   119) The teaching of the truth provides clear signs (evidence), and whoever recognises and understands them shall
    find true love and peace in himself or herself, as well as freedom and unity (harmony); guide your inner world
    (consciousness) on a pilgrimage to the truth, so that you fulfil your duty of unfolding (evolution/growth), which
    is the sense of the life.
   120) Anyone amongst you who persists in unknowledge and does not follow the duty to follow the truth, may con-
    sider that although you are independent from all created creations (creations) in your will (have free will), you
    are however subject to the laws and recommendations of the Creation and of the appearance (nature) that it
    has created, therefore you cannot escape them and determine your life yourselves for good or ill through your
    bearing (behaviour) by your own account (responsibility).
   121) Why do you deny the truth and therefore also the teaching of the prophets and their signs (marvels) which
    demonstrate the truth to you?
   122) And why do you keep all of those away from the truth-teaching who are striving to search for the real truth
    and are willing to follow the laws and recommendations of the knowledge and wisdom?
   123) And why do you try to make the straight way of the truth into a crooked one considering you are yourselves
    witnesses to the signs (evidence) of the prophets and their truth-teaching; but know that your slanderous
    (calumnious) deeds will not remain without consequences for you, because you are bringing affliction and
    harm on yourselves and will have to carry them.
   124) And you who know about the truth, if you obey even in any small wise those who slander (calumniate) the
    truth then they will make you unknowing in the truth again although you had been connected to it.
   125) Ask yourselves, however, how you can once again become unknowing ones in the truth after the signs (evi-
    dence) of the truth have been brought forward to you by the prophets who dwell amongst you or who have
    dwelt amongst you time and time again and also brought you the signs (evidence) of the truth; and if you con-
    sider your question, then you will know that you can only fall away from the truth again because you are
    doubting and do not hold fast to what will truly lead you on the right way.
   126) You, however, who know about the truth of the primal raising (Creation), be respectful (deferential) in your
    knowledge and make sure that death does not befall you while turned away from the truth.
    127) And all of you keep firm to the lifeline of the truth-teaching, and do not be disunited amongst one another in
     any wise, neither in your existence with one another nor in the explanation of the teaching of the truth, the
     teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
    128) Always think of the grace (favour/mildness) of the laws and recommendations of the origin (Creation) when
     you are following them; therefore also think of the grace (favour/mildness) which you shall give to those who
     call themselves your enemies, so that enmity may turn into true friendship; come together in love and bring
     understanding (insight) forth for one another so that you may be like brothers and sisters, and may respect
     and protect one another.
    129) Do not bring yourselves to the edge of a firing pit due to enmity, rather guard yourselves against this so that you do not fall headlong into one and are not burned beyond recognition as a result of your hatred and your
    pathological craving for revenge; fulfil the laws and recommendations of the Creation and of the appearance
    (nature) clearly and decisively, as has been taught you by the true prophets, so that you may be rightly guided.
    130) And see to it that there is a growing community of people of your kind (fellow human beings) amongst you
     which strives to fulfil the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and good-
     ness, and which incites (instructs) to the right and refuses the unright, so that it may go well with you.
    131) And do not become separated or contradictory or disunited amongst one another in any wise and for what-
     ever reason, but instead take the clear evidence of the prophets and live in love with one another so that you
     do not bring down any punishment on yourselves.
    132) See to it that your faces do not become darkened through inequity (unfairness) and unknowledgeness in the
     truth, rather make sure that your faces are brightened by equitableness (fairness) and knowledge in the truth
     and its teaching as has been given by the prophets in accordance with the laws and recommendations of the
     fruitfulness (Creation).
    133) Those whose faces are darkened by lying and deception, by slander (calumny) and all disastrous things, they are separating themselves from the community of the fair ones (responsible ones) and those knowing of the truth.
    134) And those whose faces are brightened by their love of the truth, their knowledge, their wisdom, their equi- tableness (fairness) and their respect (deference) for the truth, they will be in the grace of very many people of
    your kind (human beings) and will dwell amongst them as esteemed ones and ones who are always welcome.
    135) These are also signs (evidence) of the laws and recommendations of knowledge, of wisdom and the laws and
     recommendations of the Creation and the appearance (nature); and these are also signs (evidence) of the
     prophets who bring them forth to you because they encompass the truth and they give them because they do
     not want any inequity (unfairness) or unknowledge in the truth amongst you.
    136) The primal wellspring of wisdom (Creation) is everything that exists in the firmaments (universe) and on the
     earths (worlds/planets), and it has presented everything before you so that you may manage it rightfully and
     may also be rightful yourselves, therefore you may decide to act rightfully in all things.
    137) You are the best created creations (life forms) who have arisen for the benefit of all people of your kind (human
     beings), therefore you shall also bring the benefit to people of your kind (fellow human beings) and not wage
     any battles (wars) amongst one another; you shall safeguard the rights amongst one another and protect your-
     selves against all unright by following the guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) of the primal wellspring of
     wisdom (Creation), its laws and recommendations that are given to you by the true prophets.
    138) And know that if you open your ears to the teaching of the prophets then truly you dedicate yourselves to (are being loyal to) the guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) of the existence and it will be better for you.
    139) And heed the teaching of the true prophets because only they teach the guideline (sign-posting/leading
     thought) of the primal wellspring of wisdom (Creation), the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
     teaching of the life, because they teach love and peace, freedom and unity (harmony); and do not heed the
     false prophets who only teach the guidelines of evil so that there may be lovelessness and unpeace as well as
     unfreedom and disunity (disharmony) amongst you, just as they also commit manslaughter and bloody deeds
     (murder) and teach punishments as laws of their fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods so that you are sub-
     jugated and submissive (in bondage) to them and are biddable out of fear of punishment, and they can fleece
     (exploit) you and subdue (master) you.
    140) Be on your guard against the false prophets, because then they can only do you little or even no harm; and
     when they are against you in order to influence you with their false teachings then turn your back on them
     and in this wise they will not find any victims in you.
    141) If you turn away from the false prophets, then they will be smitten with ignominy wherever they are met, unless you let them close to you and you offer them your protection; but know that the false prophets bring
    delusional teachings of fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, as do equally their priests and other servants
    of tin gods, so that you shall follow the false teachings and kill and punish in the name of the gods and tin
    gods; consider that true prophets do not bring any teaching of this kind, but the teaching of the truth, the
    teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, and this does not include either laws or recommendations that
    instruct (command) to kill, put to the ordeal (torture) or punish; because in truth the truth-teaching of the true
    prophets is based on the laws and recommendations of the Creation which do not know manslaughter and
    bloody deeds (murder) and also do not know ordeal (torture) or punishment, but only true love and peace as well as freedom and concordance (harmony); therefore you shall be watchful and detect the false prophets by their speaking just as you detect their priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods who spread the insidious and deceitful teachings of the false prophets so that you shall bow down (be in bondage) to them and their false teachings.
    142) Do not agitate yourselves in rage because of the fabulated (invented) and falsified teachings of the false
     prophets which are nonsensical and deceitful to the truth, as well as their priests and other servants of gods
     and servants of tin gods; and do not fall into misery because of the falsified teachings of the false prophets
     who have since time immemorial rejected the true teaching of the truth and its signs (evidence), just as they
     also do today, so that you unrighteously kill (murder), put to the ordeal (torture) and punish as since time
     immemorial; be on your guard against the false prophets and their deceitful and insidious teachings, and also
     against those who bring the false teachings of the false prophets and fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods
     amongst you as priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because they are rebels and outra-
     geous ones (irresponsible ones) against the truth of the formation (Creation) and its laws and recommenda -
     tions.
    143) Truly, you are not all the same, because there are some amongst you who follow the bond with the truth and
     lead your existence accordingly, so you care for the truth in word and in teaching, both in the daytime and in
     the hours of night; but there are also some amongst you who are connected to a belief in gods and tin gods,
     in liberators (angels) and demons and in venerable ones (holy ones) and in godheads and the like, in such doing
     you are following a false teaching and are cursing the truth; but you who do such things, you are imposing a
     harmful punishment of lovelessness, hatred, pathological craving for revenge, unpeace, unfreedom and dis-
     sonance (disharmony) on yourselves.
    144) Know always about the truthly truth of the formation (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, thereby
     bringing about the right and demanding the unright its rightlessness.
    145) Compete with one another to do good deeds and always retain your righteousness (conscientiousness); and
     for the good deeds that you do and for retaining your righteousness (conscientiousness) you shall receive your
     fair (appropriate) reward, and your good deeds and your righteousness (conscientiousness) shall not be dis-
     puted, because whoever knows the truth shall esteem it well and recognise it in deference (esteem).
    146) Curses and damnation shall not be called down (wished) on the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and truth-
     deniers, the thieves and deceivers, the murderers and all those who do unright, rather they shall be given the
     prospect (possibility) in accordance with the right and law and appropriately in accordance with the laws and
     recommendations of the primal power (Creation) to be able to understand their doing unright through learning
     the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, which shall also apply if the ful-
     filment of guidelines (punishment by separation from the society for a certain time) is ordered; goods that are
     wangled (grifted) through unright or goods that are obtained in any other wise through unright shall not bene-
     fit the thieves and deceivers and all other unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), because it shall be taken
     away from them and given back to those from whom it was expropriated (stolen) in one wise or another; and
     damage done to goods and chattels and possessions through doing unright shall be remedied to the full extent
     by the fallible ones, whether the remedy takes the form of performing a service (work) or repaying the liability
     for the damage in the form of currency.
    147) You are unfair amongst yourselves and therefore against yourselves, therefore you shall learn equitableness
     (fairness) against yourselves and against people of your kind (human beings) so that you may find a peaceful
     coexistence and peace in yourselves.
    148) Do not throw away your life on Earth in unknowledge of the truth of the primal power (Creation) so that you
     will not be destructive like the whirlwind which blows through the arable crops with icy unweather and de-
     stroys them; do not commit outrages against your existence and therefore also not against the continuance of
     your world through unknowledge, because otherwise you will destroy yourselves as well as your earth and your
     appearance (nature); be at all times moderate in all things and do not drive up the number of your descen-
     dants into copiousness (vastness/enormousness/unlimitedness), so that you will not become the destroyers of
     your world, and it does not rebel against you in misery and pain and protect itself against your destructive
     frenzy with primal Gewalt and does not crush you and your creations (achievements).
    149) You who are knowing in the truth-teaching, do not take those as trusted friends who do not stand up for you
     and only feign friendship as long as they have a premium (benefit) from you, but do not remember their friend-
     ship any longer when you fall into misery and need their help.
    150) And you who are knowing in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, do
     not take those as your trusted friends who are far from the truth-teaching and are unwilling to understand and
     accept you as ones who have knowledge of the truth, because they will not fail (neglect) to destroy you; and
     truly they like it when you are struck by calamity; and their hatred against you will quickly become apparent
     from their mouth, but what their breast (feeling-centre) conceals (hides) is even worse; and truly they do not
     want to understand the laws and recommendations of the life.
     151) If you are fair ones (responsible ones) and ones knowing of the truth, then you doubtless love those who believe
      themselves to be your enemies, because they consider themselves as your enemies although you are not theirs,
      but they do not love you nevertheless; the ones who see themselves as your enemies, but you do not see them
      as yours, you love them because you act in love in accordance with the truth-teaching which teaches that all
      people of your kind (human beings) are equivalent (equal) to one another as people of your kind (human
      beings); those who believe themselves to be your enemies do not love you however, rather they are deceiving
      you because they pretend to you that they are connected to the truth although they are not, and when they
      are alone then they gnaw their fingertips in rage against you; and they would prefer to die in their rage against
      you than to resolve their enmity and their rage and hatred against you in themselves.
     152) Truly, if something good happens to you then it pains those who believe that they are your enemies, but if
      something evil happens to you then they rejoice over it and laugh; but remain steadfast and upright in spite
      of their doings and esteem them as people of your kind (human beings) and embrace them with love, then
      their intrigues will not harm you.
     153) Consider that when you get up early in the morning and go out of your house that you shall always be friendly and
      good to yourselves, as well as to all those whom you meet and with whom you have doings, so that neither you
      nor anyone else may fall into agitation about you.
     154) Never reflect upon chickenheartedness (cowardice), but always be upright, daring (bold) and joyful so that you
      give yourselves power and the others respect and honour you.
     155) Never be connected to chickenheartedness (cowardice), but always stand by yourselves with great bravery, so that
      you may never be weak in any things and so that you may take yourselves as protectors in all things, so you may
      be thankful to yourselves.
     156) It is not sufficient for you that the prophets bring you signs (evidence) and the teaching of the truth, since you
      are striving with false teachings to be like your fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods and you obstinately
      allow yourselves to be led into confusion by their priests and other servants (hands/helpers), believing that your
      god or tin gods are sending liberators (angels) down to you who shall come to your aid when you are fighting
      in a battle (war) with those whom you have raised up as your enemies.
     157) And as you make enemies for yourselves, so they come over you in reckless haste, but no liberators (angels)
      will come storming out of the clouds (from the firmament) from your gods and tin gods in order to hurry to
      your aid, because liberators (angels) from gods and tin gods are just as much fabulated (invented), unsubstan-
      tial formations by people of your kind (human beings) as are the gods and tin gods themselves.
     158) Therefore you shall arrange yourselves according to the real truth as is given to you by the teaching of the
      prophets, so that you may accept their joyful message in yourselves in order to calm yourselves in your inner
      world (consciousness) in your intention and consideration (reflexions and strivings); and truly, if help is given to
      you in any things, then it comes from you alone because as far as you are concerned you are the mighty ones
      and those who have to create knowledge and wisdom in yourselves.
     159) However, so many amongst you are inconstant, which is why you cut off parts of the truth as unknowing ones
      and debase yourselves thereby, this explains why you often have to turn away from unfulfilled things of evil
      when the truth catches up to you.
     160) It is your task alone to turn to yourselves in clemency (kindheartedness) and to make yourselves into ones
      knowing of the truth, as it is also your significance (concern/matter) whether you punish yourselves by being
      malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth.
     161) Everything that exists in the firmaments (universe) and on the earths (worlds/planets) belongs to the primal
      power of the love (Creation), but you are the ones to whom it is given to forgive yourselves or to punish your-
      selves according to equitableness (fairness).
     162) All those amongst you who are ones who have knowledge of the truth and fair ones (responsible ones) and
      righteous ones (conscientious ones), do not gobble up a markup (interest) and markup on markup (compound
      interest) when you give advances (loans) or borrowing (loaned money) or mortgaging (pledged money/surety
      money) but only demand a markup (interest) and settlement in a fair (tolerable) wise, so that you are not rapa-
      cious ones (avaricious ones/usurers) and so that it may go well with you.
     163) Fear rapacity (practising usury) and the fire of unknowledge if you turn away from the teaching of the truth,
      the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and become depraved in yourselves by creating lovelessness and
      unpeace as well as unfreedom and dissonance (disharmony) in yourselves.
     164) Listen to the teaching of the prophets and their words of the truth-teaching, so that you may find grace (kind-
      heartedness) and mildness in your existence.
     165) And compete with one another in assiduousness (striving) for true love and for peace, as well as for freedom and consonance (harmony) so that you may forgive all those who assume they are your enemies, so that you
     may create a paradise on your world and honour and dignity may be yours, as is planned through the laws
     and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) for all of you who shall be truth-knowing and raised
     above all untruth, above all unright and all evil, as well as above enmity and battle (war), above hatred and
     jealousy, unfair (irresponsible) punishment and ordeal (torture), above revenge and retaliation and everything that is against the guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) of the primal power (Creation).
     166) You are rightfully fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones) if you give contributions
      (alms/donations) to the poor and needy, whether you are in fortunate or unfortunate circumstances; and you
      are also fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones) if you do not allow any anger and
      hatred, as well as any revenge and jealousy and anything else that is unright to arise in yourselves; and you are
      also fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones) if you evince (grant/show) forgiveness
      to people of your kind (fellow human beings) and show goodness to them.
     167) And those amongst you who commit a misdeed or an outrage against yourselves, consider your infamous
      action (crime) and search for forgiveness so that it may go well with you and you do not knowingly (con-
      sciously) persist in your unright doing.
     168) And if you give forgiveness to yourselves and ask for forgiveness from all those to whom you have done
      unright, then your reward will be a garden of happiness and joy in which a stream of true love and of peace
      as well as of true freedom and consonance (harmony) will flow; you will remain in the garden of happiness
      and joy as the reward for what you affect through your effort.
     169) Before your time, the true prophets presented and explained many laws and recommendations of the creative
      (Creation) and of the appearance (nature) proceeding from it, so that you may receive a guideline (sign-
      posting/leading thought) for your existence and how to lead your life; therefore you shall take up the teaching
      of the true prophets so that you wander across Earth and see that your end will be good, not however like
      those who slander (calumniate) the truth and accuse (blame) the true prophets of lying.
     170) The teaching of the prophets is a clear explanation for people of your kind (human beings) and a guideline
      (sign-posting/leading thought) and admonishment so that you may be fair (responsible) and righteous (conscien-
      tious) and truth-knowing and so that you may vilify (curse) everything that is unright and that you may only
      do what is rightful.
     171) Do not tire in doing what is fair (responsible) and righteous (conscientious), and do not sorrow about terrible
      things and unfortune in the past, just as you do not sorrow about inequity (unfairness) that is done to you and
      everything that is of unright that has been blamed (ascribed) to you; do at all times what is rightful and let by-
      gones be bygones so that you may prevail (gain the upper hand) over everything of the past and not wail over
      what has come and gone (things of the past) and inconstant (mortal) things.
     172) If you as ones knowing of the truth incur a wound, then be certain (knowing) that those who have no knowl-
      edge of the truth incur similar wounds, because everything is changing amongst the people of your kind
      (human beings) so that they may be admonished from this to learn in consciousness (consciously) and to dif-
      ferentiate themselves from animals and other creatures which are not capable (able) to learn in consciousness
      (consciously); truly, the person of your kind (human being) is set apart from the beasts and from all animals and
      other creatures by his or her ability to learn in consciousness (consciously) whereas the beasts and all animals
      and other creatures only learn through their urges (instincts) and are not skilful (capable) of thoughts.
     173) Be at all times faithful to the truth-teaching and cleanse yourselves daily from all inequitable things (errors/
      unrights) that you cannot avoid doing in order to bring fullness (sufficiency) to your unfolding (evolution) so
      that you may be constantly ever more fair (responsible) and knowing and therefore wiser, so that you are
      witnesses to the truth; therefore you shall eradicate everything inequitable from yourselves by granting your-
      selves cleansing from it.
     174) Do not assume (believe) that you will enter the realm of the truth as long as you have not decided in favour
      of it and you do not yet distinguish yourselves from those who are openly connected to the untruth and
      unknowledge; assume (believe) only that you will enter the realm of the truth and of the love, peace and free-
      dom, as well as of the harmony if you are steadfast ones in following the truth and its laws and recommen-
      dations.
     175) Quite a few amongst you have the habit of wishing for death before you meet it in a natural wise, but consider
      that if you look out for it without it coming to you at a time of its own choosing, then you are malefactors
      (lawbreakers) against the life and against the laws and recommendations of the creative (Creation) and against
      its appearance (nature); truly, bringing death at one's own hand and being your own murderer in chicken -
      heartedness (cowardice) is killing in Ausartung and against the laws of the life.
     176) Do not believe that you may die after a predetermined period of time, because there is no decision by fabu-
      lated (invented) gods and tin gods for how long your existence shall continue; truly, death comes to everyone
      in its own time which is determined by the inner and outer foreordination (destiny), such as age or illness, ac -
      cident or Gewalt and other things that bring life to an end.
     177) And whoever desires the reward of the world, it will be given to them according to their share (merit), and
      whoever desires the reward of the life, that is obtaining a peaceful death, that human being will receive it in
      due measure (according to) the unfolding (evolution) of his or her inner world (consciousness).
      178) And everyone will receive their reward according to what they merit, so also dying as a conversion (transition/
       change) to death will take the form that corresponds to the reward of the life.
      179) The true prophets decide themselves to carry out their determination (mission) by learning the laws and recom-
       mendations of the creative (Creation) and appearance (nature) in order to teach them to you in love and dedi-
       cation, so that you may lead a good existence and recognise the truth, so that you may create true love and
       true peace in yourselves and around yourselves, from which true freedom and harmony may arise.
      180) Truly, the old true prophets have gone before you to teach you and to guide you, but you persecuted them
       and you made attempts on their life, because you did not turn around and do not follow in their footsteps
       (you do not turn to the truth-teaching); but as you do not turn round to the truth and you follow in the foot-
       steps (follow the beliefs) of the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and the unknowing ones, so you continue to
       hound the true prophets and make attempts on their life; however, consider that even if you hound the true
       prophets and try to kill them, you still cannot harm their teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching
       of the life in the slightest wise, because it exists for all time and is therefore indestructible, because it goes forth
       as instruction from the truth of the creative (Creation) and from its laws and recommendations; and truly if you
       turn yourselves to the instruction then you will be able to evince (grant) thankfulness to yourselves.
      181) And there have been so many false prophets at whose side numerous crowds fought for false teachings of
       fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods and their priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods, in this
       wise innumerable people of your kind (human beings) were killed (murdered) with evil Gewalt and bloodlust,
       and others were forced into a servitude (bondage) in the belief of the battle hordes (war hordes); and as it was
       like this in times of old before you, it continues to be so because you are convinced in your false belief in gods
       and tin gods as well as being believers in your demoniacal faith; and you do not notice that your fabulated
       (invented) gods and tin gods as well as their priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods are
       proclaiming love and peace as well as freedom and harmony, whilst however demanding revenge and punish-
       ment as well as battle (war) and Gewalt and retaliation by speaking in favour of the death penalty and killing
       (murdering) in battles (wars) thereby anointing (blessing) murderous weapons and the sword of justice for spilling
       blood of your kind (blood of human beings) in the name of their gods and tin gods.
      182) In truth, true prophets have stood up (appeared) and have brought the teaching of the truth, the teaching of
       the spirit, the teaching of the life, but all those who were given the task of writing down the prophets' truth-
       teaching misrepresented it with falsifications and deceptions and lies, and therefore with fabulated (invented)
       additions and with false explanations, in this wise they created teachings of lies; and those who taught and
       followed the teachings of lies as higher ones committed deception in the name of the true prophets and evoked
       battles (wars) for spreading a fabulated (invented) belief; and they falsified the petition (intercession) of the
       truth and the records (chronicle/writing of history) and falsely attributed their wrongdoings to the true prophets
       so that these may be held to blame (responsible) for battles (wars) and deaths as well as for Gewalt and coer-
       cion and for all terrible things, although they did not have any share in the battle (war) and bloody deed (mur-
       der) and destruction and in all Ausartungen; therefore, however, it will be that the last prophet from the line
       of Nokodemion in the new time will be equipped with all necessary things and will be well versed in writing,
       so that he will no longer need scribes, therefore he will know how to record the teaching of the truth, the
       teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life as set down in the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, and will bring it to
       permanence in his own words.
      183) Do not hesitate, because whatever may happen to you and whatever hits you, you have since time immemo-
       rial and now and also in the most distant coming time in your possession the teaching of the true prophets so
       that you may not become submissive or weak before yourselves and also not before those who believe they
       are your enemies.
      184) And always speak the truth and be the steadfast ones so that you cannot be accused of lying or slander
       (calumny); and forgive the people of your kind (human beings) their errors as well as their misdemeanours in
       their conduct, in this wise you may strengthen your and their steps so that peace and concord (harmony) may
       prevail amongst you.
      185) Consider that you receive the reward of this world according to how you unite amongst one another (live
       together) and how you do good things amongst one another and practise true love.
      186) Consider that if you lend your ear to and listen to those who are wallowing in the untruth and unknowledge-
       ness, then the result will be that you will turn about on your heels (deny the truth) and you will be the ones
       to lose.
      187) The prophets are the protectors of the truth-teaching, and you shall be both the protectors of the true prophets
       and also the protectors of the truth-teaching, not only at the times when the prophets are living but also there -
       after, so that the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life may become the
       guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) to all peoples of your kind (humankind) for following the laws and
       recommendations of the primal raising (Creation).
       188) Do not be alarmed if you turn away from the untruth and from the unknowledge about the truth and turn
        towards the guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) of the life and of the real truth and you commit (obligate)
        yourselves, and if you do not place any fabulated (invented) false teachings of baseless (invented) gods and tin
        gods as rivals next to the truth; the truth does not grant any authorisation for falseness and lying which dwells
        in the fire of evil and is the place of shelter for malefactors against the truth.
       189) Truly, the true prophets have always kept their promises even if there were some amongst you who beat them
        and threatened (menaced) them with death and hounded them because you wavered in recognising and
        accepting the truth and loved being connected to the lie instead of to the truth.
       190) And since time immemorial there have been many amongst you and there remain many amongst you today
        who ask for this world of the visible but also ask for the world of the invisible in order to test the prophets
        because you do not want the truth to be true; but the prophets forgive you, because they are kindhearted
        towards you who are unknowing and do after all want to find the way to the truth.
       191) Do not go forth and look around you when the prophets are calling out their teaching behind you, so that you
        may not endure any suffering and may not sorrow about the evil and disastrous things that you will lose which
        befell you a long time ago and drove you into fleeing from the teaching of the truth.
       192) Let there be innocent love and peace, as well as freedom and consonance (harmony) in you and about you
        through the teaching of the prophets, so that you may cultivate your dignity as people of your kind (being
        human in the real and true sense) and do not give any reason for resentment and rage.
       193) Since time immemorial, the true prophets have brought the teaching to you for peace and for love, not how-
        ever false teachings of evil which call for battles (wars) and bloody deeds (murder) and destruction; in truth,
        many of you lead a life as if you were lying in a troubled slumber tormented by anxious dreams (nightmares/
        incubus) because you are living against the truth and only for yourselves and because you are not bringing your
        inner world (consciousness) to unfolding (evolution).
       194) Truly, you are wrongly thinking thoughts of the unknowledgeness and of the untruth, and therefore you do
        not have any share in the regulation of things as they are given by the laws and recommendations of the
        Creation; and also the regulation of all things shall be a task (cause) for you; and therefore you shall fathom
        out in the regulation of all things what of its sense has been hidden from you, so that you may understand
        what the guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) of the life is.
       195) If you had used a share of the regulation of all things for yourselves, then you would not kill people of your kind (fellow human beings), and therefore you would not steal or deceive, you would not hate or practise
       revenge and retaliation, neither would you harbour jealousy or fall prey to battles (wars) and all Ausartung.
       196) If you had remained by the truth-teaching since time immemorial as was brought to you by the true proclaimers,
        the prophets, then you would not have lowered yourselves (debased yourselves) allowing yourselves to be
        driven into hatred and pathological craving for revenge and into battles (wars) and into all Ausartungen by the
        rulers and authorities, as well as by false prophets and fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods and their priests
        and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods; if you had remained by the truth-teaching since time
        immemorial, then you would not have allowed yourselves to be commanded to go out in order to wreak deca-
        dence, manslaughter and bloody deeds (murder) and pillage by wars (battles) and transgressions (illegality) and
        outrages (crimes), thereby complying with (following) the evil and false resolutions of the instigators (fomenters/
        hatemongers) and ringleaders; at all times you would have had to prove yourselves in order to stand against
        the Gewalt-rulers and other lords and their demagogues so that you would have cast them from their throne
        and replaced them with true leaders; truly, at all times the people shall provide its own leadership if it does so
        rightfully so that the higher ones are only delegated ones (deputies) of the people and do not have might over
        the people but are only carrying out the will of the people because it is the people itself that shall decide on
        its prosperity and adversity and not be constrained by rulers and lords and the higher ones as well as by false
        prophets or priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods; therefore, every authority shall be appointed
        by the people so that it stands in the people's favour and only carries out the instructions (directives) through
        having been authorised (empowered) by the people.
       197) May the resolution ripen in you that you prove everything so that you may reform (clarify) everything that must
        be done so that your authorities follow the will of the people rather than you follow the will of the author-
        ities; as a people you shall be decisive for your prosperity and adversity, under the good teaching of the teach-
        ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life which is given as the ‹Goblet of the Truth› by
        the true prophets from the line of Nokodemion, the originator of all true prophets of his line who taught true
        love and true peace as well as true freedom and harmony.
       198) Those amongst you who turn your back on yourselves in enmity, truly you are stumbling because of certain
        things which you do amongst one another in unright, but you shall not meet one another in enmity, rather
        you shall forgive one another and be forbearing; truly, it is not seemly for people of your kind (human beings)
        to hold people of your kind in enmity because this brings torments and depravity in the thoughts and in the
        feelings as well as in the psyche and the inner world (consciousness).
        199) Do not persist in unknowledge so that you do not wander through the land with evil intent or depart for a bat-
         tle (war) and so that you do not load blame on yourselves or so that you do not come to the sense that it would
         be better to die or be slain rather than having to live with an unbearable tormenting guilt.
        200) And if you have reason for remorse due to a light or heavy burden of guilt that you have loaded on yourselves,
         then nevertheless give priority to life and do not presume to accommodate (to abet) death because you do not
         want to give account for your guilt in chickenheartedness (cowardice); life is given for fulfilment so that it may
         be savoured in good time when existence is full of kindheartedness and joy, but that it shall also be endured
         in misery and poor times when existence is difficult to bear and full of pain and sorrow.
        201) If you throw away your life and you die at your own hand or that of hired murderers, whatever the reason for this may be, then truly that is inexcusable for you since such actions are a breach of the law of the life which
        says that you shall not kill in Ausartung; robbing yourselves of the life and therefore killing (murdering) your-
        selves or having yourselves assassinated by hired killers (murderers) means killing in Ausartung and is a breach
        against all laws and recommendations of the life which do not give motivation or teach in favour of death and
        ruin, but rather the maintenance of the life (affirmation of the life) in all its twists and turns (kinds/forms).
        202) And if you should be slain or otherwise killed (murdered) because of the truth, then it is truly better to forgive those who are against you in this wise and to follow their demand for silence and to keep the truth in your-
        selves, than to be separated from the truth; but be certain (knowing) that you are not commanded to have
        yourselves slain or otherwise killed (murdered) on behalf of the truth, because it is recommended to you that
        you shall consider (decide) yourselves what your foreordination (destiny) shall be; however, consider that being
        slain or otherwise being killed because of the truth is against the laws and recommendations of the creative
        (Creation) and it is consequently permitted to maintain a distance (not to spread the truth-teaching or teach it
        in any other wise) outwardly from the adversaries of the truth, and only to care for the truth in your own inner
        world (consciousness) and in your thoughts so that you may be sure of your life; truly, it is better to keep quiet
        about the truth than to be slain or otherwise killed (murdered) because of it, because it is certain that at a later
        time the truth can once again be disclosed when there is no longer any danger of losing one's life; therefore
        you shall not allow yourselves to be slain or otherwise killed (murdered) because of the truth, but instead show
        yourselves amenable through silence whilst however safeguarding your knowledge of the truth in yourselves
        and leading your existence in the sense of the truth, only to break your silence when you are out of danger.
        203) For the sake of benevolence (humanity) and equitableness (fairness) and truth, be gentle to all those who are
         against you and against the teaching of the truth, because if you were to be harsh and hard to them then they
         would curse you and insult you; forgive all those who are against you and against the truth and try to consult
         with them in trust so that they may become better disposed towards you; and therefore it may be that you
         consult them in questions of administration of any particular things so that they become aware of your trust
         and carry the insight; and if they have decided in favour of you and for goodness, then place even more trust
         in them and you will win friendship with them.
        204) If you are upstanding and fair and place trust in yourselves, then no-one will prevail over you with unright and inequity (unfairness), but if you abandon your steadfastness and your being fair and you lose your trust then
        no-one can help you, and the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and fraudulent ones will gain Gewalt over you.
        205) Act at all times like the true prophets who are incapable of acting dishonourably, but if you act dishonourably
         and you defraud the truth then the time will come about in which harm arises in yourselves and you are tor-
         mented by lovelessness and unpeace as well as by unfreedom and divisiveness (disharmony); each of your
         actions will be fully paid back to you in some wise or other according to what you merit, both in good and evil
         and in right and unright.
        206) Truly if you go for the pleasure of the truth, then you will also reap pleasure from people of your kind (human
         beings), but if you draw down the rage of people of your kind (human beings) on yourselves then you will
         kindle a dwelling of the shadow world (hell) in yourselves for your thoughts and feelings, therefore your inner
         world (consciousness) and your psyche will become sorrowful.
        207) Truly, if you are knowing of the truth and its teaching, then as ones who have knowledge of the truth you only
         have different levels with different sublevels in terms of (according to) the scope of knowledge, but you do not
         have any levels as people of your kind (human beings), because you are all equal.
        208) As you are all equal as people of your kind (human beings), so are also the prophets who are always people of your kind (human beings), even if their knowledge about the truth of the creative (Creation) and the teach -
        ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life exceeds your own knowledge many times
        over; and the true prophets always show their courage, as you shall also prove your courage in recognising the
        truth, accepting it and speaking it aloud; consider at all times: only the brave ones, the fair ones (responsible
        ones) and the righteous ones (conscientious ones) speak the truth, whereas the fainthearted ones, the unfair
        ones (irresponsible ones) and the unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) remain far from the truth and do not have the attitude (mentality) to speak it aloud.
        209) The true prophets give you grace (kindheartedness) when they arise from your midst and give you signs (evi-
         dence) of the truth and present the word of the truth of the creative (Creation) before you; therefore you are
         recommended to cleanse your striving and to learn the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
         teaching of the life from the your true prophets so that you may be free from the false teachings of false
         prophets and their gods and tin gods, as well as also from their priests and other servants of gods and servants
         of tin gods.
        210) If a calamity strikes you in your inner world (consciousness) as well as in your thoughts and feelings and in your
         psyche in a simple or double wise, then consider that it comes from you yourselves, because you truly have the
         might in yourselves over all of your own things.
        211) And to enable you to distinguish the pretenders (hypocrites) from the upstanding ones, fight with the words
         of the truth against them and put them to the proof and test so that you understand how to recognise their
         attitude (mentality) because they only speak with their mouth, but not with truth of knowledge, so they are
         going astray in their speaking.
        212) And do not follow those who are pretending (hypocritical), because they do not keep death away from them-
         selves, instead they kill themselves in chickenheartedness (cowardice) when they are sick of the life or when it
         is difficult for them and they do not want to bear the difficulty of existence; truly, those who are sunk into
         chickenheartedness (cowardice) are close to the unlife (misery) and the untruth, but they do not want to accept
         it.
        213) If those who came before you (ancestors/forebears) had listened to the truth-teaching of the true prophets,
         then they would not have slain and killed (murdered) one another, just as they would have kept death away
         from themselves and would not have laid a hand on their own life (committed suicide), because truly the teach-
         ing of the veritable (true/genuine) prophets teaches the empowerment for life and maintaining it, not however
         strangulation, nor slaying or spilling blood (committing murder) of another kind or the chickenhearted (cow-
         ardly) flight into death at one's own hand or that of an assassin.
        214) And if people of your kind (human beings) amongst you are slain or otherwise killed (murdered), then the
         reprehensible (villainous) actions of the murderers shall be punished in the form that the woman is separated
         from the man or the man is separated from the woman (excluded from society and from the other sex) and
         ostracised (separated/cast out/outlawed/banished) for life or for another suitable period at a place of fulfilment
         of guidelines (secluded region or island), according to the severity of the bloody deed (murder); and truly, it
         shall not be permitted for those who commit bloody deeds (murderers) to go unpunished, rather it shall be
         that they are punished and taken to a place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded regions or islands); therefore
         it shall not be permitted either for the reprehensible (villainous) deeds of the murderers to be remedied and
         amends made for them by blood money (blood gelt) thereby escaping punishment and a place of fulfilment
         of guidelines (secluded regions or islands); however it is also not permitted to pay back in kind and demand
         blood for blood, and therefore not to slay or throttle murderers either, just as they must not be hanged, stoned
         or killed (murdered) by poison, neither shall they be decapitated nor killed (murdered) in any other wise because
         such acts are the same as the bloody deed (murder) and are based in revenge and in retaliation which are
         against the laws and recommendations of the life and the creative (Creation).
        215) And if children and young people (youths) amongst you make themselves guilty of a bloody deed (murder)
         then they shall be taken for punishment and to a place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded region or island)
         in the same wise as for those who have grown up (adults), thus a lifetime or other appropriate period in the
         place of fulfilment of guidelines (punishment by separation from society for a certain time), determined accord -
         ing to the severity of the bloody deed (murderous deed), also applies for them.
        216) Do not think that those who are slain or otherwise killed (murdered) for the truth or untruth will enter into the
         presence of a paradise of a god or tin gods because no-one receives this who enters into the life of death
         (death-life) because truly, with dying, a person of your kind (human being) ceases to exist, because death
         brings dissolution to the activity (energy), and out of this a new person of your kind (human being/personal-
         ity) with a new inner world (consciousness) is created; and it is taught that the spirit-body (spirit-form) of
         people of your kind (human beings) is a tiny dot (minute thing) of activity (energy) of the Creation and is not
         bound to death so that this is existing in the realm of the invisible (other world) and shows (manifests) itself in
         renewal (rebirth) once again in a new person of your kind (human being).
        217) If you follow the laws and recommendations of the truth of the Creation, then you are granting yourselves
         delight and grace (kindheartedness), therefore you are full of joy when you follow the truth, and truly you will
         have neither fear nor sorrow which you are not capable of mastering.
        218) And truly you will be full of joy about the truth if you lead your existence in it, and therefore the reward for
         this will not be lost to you.
         219) Those amongst you who follow the call and the teaching of the prophets after having lived in dark unknowl-
          edgeness and received evil wounds to your inner world (consciousness) and in your thoughts and feelings as
          well as in your psyche, you will reap a great reward if you do good and act rightfully.
         220) It is probable that unknowing ones and unfair ones (irresponsible ones) as well as unrighteous ones (con-
          scienceless ones) have gathered around you, but do not be afraid of them, rather let their bad deeds strengthen
          you and give fullness (sufficiency) to the teaching of the truth so that the truth itself will be a comprehensive
          protection for you.
         221) Return to the truth-teaching and to the laws and recommendations of the Creation with kindheartedness and
          understanding, so that no disastrous things will strike you and you will find pleasure in true life, because you
          are yourselves those who show esteem, favour and mildness to yourselves.
         222) Do not be afraid of evil and its friends who wish to frighten you with misdeeds; only be afraid of committing
          misdeeds and inequity (unfairness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness) yourselves when you are ones
          who have knowledge of the truth.
         223) Do not allow yourselves to be afflicted by those who quickly fall prey to evil and unrightfulness, because indeed
          they cannot harm the truth and yourselves in any wise if you remain steadfast; always be willing to give them
          a share of your knowledge so that they do not have to continue in unknowledge and in their cursedness and
          therefore do not have to persist in their inequity (unfairness).
         224) It is certain that those who have bartered unknowledgeness and delusional teachings for the truth in order to
          gain a belief in a god or tin gods, that they cannot harm you or the truth in any wise if you are steadfast in
          the knowledge of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and in the laws
          and recommendations of the origination (Creation).
         225) And those who are unknowing ones in the truth and the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) shall not assume that
          it will be to their boon that they deny or slander (calumniate) the truth, because indeed it will only lead to all
          disastrous things growing in them and they are debasing themselves.
         226) Do not think that you can leave yourselves in the position of unknowledge of the truth, in which you find your-
          selves, because you must separate yourselves from what is bad and turn yourselves to goodness, therefore you
          must be concerned about learning so that what is hidden in the truth may be disclosed to you; therefore
          choose the teaching of the prophets because if you make their knowledge and wisdom your own, you will be
          upright and fair as well as virtuous, for which you will receive a great reward in yourselves, in your inner world
          (consciousness) and in the thoughts, in your feelings and in your psyche.
         227) And those amongst you who are stingy with that which has been given to you by the fruitfulness (Creation)
          in its goodness, you shall not assume that your stinginess will be for your boon and for your own good, because
          truly you will be disdained by people of your kind (human beings) as they become aware of your actions since
          you have hung avarice around you like a necklace which is visible both near and far for people of your kind
          (human beings).
         228) Your thoughts and speaking are foolish and delusional if you think and say that the truth of fruitfulness
          (Creation) is poor, but you however are rich in your unknowledge of the truth; and you have even had it writ-
          ten down by scribes, with falsification, by changing the teaching of the true prophets against the right and
          since then slanderously (defamingly) teaching that punishment and revenge as well as retaliation and battle
          (war) shall be practised against those who are of another belief and another people than your own; and the-
          refore you have slanderously (defamingly) set down in your writings that also children take up arms in order
          to go into battle (war) and kill for your false beliefs and for all conflicts (enmities/disputes), but by no means
          is this rightful, and therefore it is against the laws and recommendations of the fruitfulness (Creation) and of
          the life; and your slanders (calumnies), as you have instructed scribes to set them down incorrectly, also teach,
          against all right and against all equitableness (fairness) and against the laws and recommendations of the primal
          wellspring of wisdom (Creation), that every man and every woman shall be of death if there is a break in the
          bond between man and woman; and equally everyone shall be of death who kills (murders) or commits other
          misdeeds; but these lies and slanders (calumnies) are against the truth and the laws and recommendations of
          the wellspring of wisdom (Creation), and they are murderous (criminal) claims which are far from the truth and
          are fabulated (fraudulent) falsifications that are invented by people of your kind (human beings) with delusional
          thoughts and desires (vices/wantonness/pathological cravings/urges) in joy or vengefulness in order to torment,
          punish and kill others.
         229) For the sake of what your thoughts create and the evil deeds that arise therefrom, you flee from the truth and set unright against right, so that you may lead an existence in evil that is far from the truth in face of the life.
         230) Many amongst you are believers in gods and tin gods, just like the priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods who together with you unknowing ones and unfair ones (irresponsible ones) call not to listen to
         and heed the words or the teaching of the true prophets before they might bear witness that those would be
         destroyed in the fire of punishment who do not turn to the truth-teaching; but truly prophets have come who brought clear signs (evidence) and bore witness that ill-gotten goods never prosper and therefore do not bring forth good fruits but only rotten ones; you, however, only slandered (calumniated) them and tried to kill them because you are not truthful in the knowledge of the truth.
         231) However, those amongst you who are accused (blamed) by the unknowing ones and unfair ones (irresponsible
          ones) and by the unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) of lying, remember the true prophets who are ac -
          cused (blamed) of lying before your time and in your time, and remember the true prophets in your time who
          are also accused (blamed) of lying also by you and your priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods
          despite showing (revealing) the way to the guideline (principle/leading thought) of truthly life with clear signs
          (evidence) and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, the teaching of the
          wisdom and with their open and honest words; and you and your priests and servants of gods, your servants
          of tin gods and swaggerers, your nit-pickers (know-it-alls) and word-splitters, none of you want to perceive
          what is the truth, because for you who are truth-deniers, something that is against your belief and against your
          reflexions and strivings is not allowed to be truth.
         232) Consider: Every person of your kind (human being) will feel the dying, but even during the time of your life
          you will receive the full reward for your thoughts and feelings, as well as for your deeds and your actions in
          their time, which becomes noticeable in your inner world (consciousness) and in your psyche as also in your
          thoughts and feelings; only whoever fulfils their life appropriately, as laid down in the teaching of the truth of
          the wellspring of all life (Creation) through laws and recommendations, will be far from the fire of inner misery,
          woe and pain, and will verily achieve the true joys of existence without deceptive pleasure.
         233) Truly, amongst yourselves you will be at all times tested by people of your kind (human beings) in terms of your
          goods and chattels and therefore of your own self (consciousness/dignity/virtue/honour, etc.) and certainly you
          will hear many injurious things from those who presume to criticise your goods and chattels and yourselves;
          and the criticisers belong to those who have apparently consecrated (holy) texts which indicate base (unhu-
          mane) laws and recommendations which they follow and thereby set gods and tin gods as well as priests and
          other servants of gods and servants of tin gods at the side of the wellspring of the fruitfulness (Creation);
          however, if you remain steadfast in face of them and act in an upright wise, then truly you thereby show your
          firm decisiveness to remain in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and
          the teaching of the wellspring of the fruitfulness (Creation).
         234) Always remember that every prophet makes a bond of the connectedness with people of your kind (human
          beings) to whom he brings the teaching of the prophets, and so it will be until the last true prophet who in
          the new time will give you the writing of the extensive teaching from his own hand; and you shall then
          announce the teaching to people of your kind (human beings) and not keep it secret, just as you do not throw
          it behind you or treat (explain) it in a falsifying wise to gain the small prize of advantages (benefits) and profit,
          because everything that you buy in this wise is disastrous.
         235) Do not assume (believe) that those who rejoice in what they have done in disastrous and unfair (irresponsible)
          things, or who want to be famous for what they have not done in disastrous and unright things, do not as-
          sume (believe) that they will obtain true joy and happiness in themselves, because in truth they are assuring
          (bringing down) punishment on themselves because they are suffering a painful chastisement in their inner
          world (consciousness) and in their psyche just as much as in their thoughts and in their feelings.
         236) The truth is in the laws and recommendations of the realm of the inner world of all firmaments and earths
          (universal consciousness), and only the truth, the laws and recommendations of the inner world of all firma-
          ments and earths (universal consciousness) are mighty over all things without however ruling them in forceful-
          ness or goodness, because truly the primal power (Creation) of all existence is neither demanding nor prej-
          udiced (biased), but is only determining through its laws and recommendations which people of your kind
          (human beings) and every life (life form) is free to observe or disregard at their free consideration (discretion/
          convenience) so that the person of your kind (human being) and every life is independently responsible for his
          or her existence and his or her deeds and efforts.
         237) In the primal power (Creation) of all firmaments (universe) and earths (worlds) and the stars and in the change
          from day to night and in all existence of the living, the signs (evidence) of its truth and reality (presence/exis -
          tence) are indeed visible for the ones knowing of the truth and those who understand.
         238) All of you who think of the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation), when standing and sitting and when you are
          lying on your side pondering over the wellspring of all wisdom as well as its firmaments (universe) and earths
          (worlds), the stars and all existence of the living, then you will become knowing that you have not been cre -
          ated in vain, but that you shall fulfil the sense of existence so that you may become wise and full of love in
          your inner world (consciousness), in order to transfer these values into your spirit-body (spirit-form) which will
          one day combine (unite) with the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation).
          239) You will not be cast into the fire (hell) in yourselves because of the primal power (Creation), and therefore it
           does not throw you into defilement and helplessness because of your being malefactors (lawbreakers) either,
           for truly, if such a thing happens to you, then this happens appropriately in accordance with your own deeds
           and efforts and in your own blame (responsibility).
          240) You hear the callers of the truth-teaching, the true prophets who encourage you to turn to the truth of the
           creative (Creation) in freedom by learning the truth and recognising and following it, then you will forgive your
           own misdemeanours and take all disasters away from yourselves, so that one day you will meet your dying and
           go into death as fair ones (responsible ones) and ones who are knowing of the truth and as righteous ones
           (conscientious ones).
          241) You give yourselves what is promised to you through the true prophets through their teaching, and as you fol-
           low the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life so you do not cast yourselves
           into ignominy, but instead you experience the goodness of the laws and recommendations of the fruitfulness
           (Creation) as they are taught you through the prophets; and none of the prophets will be the same as the
           prophet of the new time, because his teaching will be of great extent and like a vast ocean wave, such as no
           prophet before him will have brought; and the wave of teaching will foam with enormous fullness and all kinds
           of richness (variety) and will flow over the world as never before; and in a wise that has never been given before,
           he will write the teaching of the truth, the teaching of s the pirit, the teaching of the life with his own hand
           so that no attributive and fabulated falsifications and slanders (calumnies) may be given by unworthy scribes,
           such as have villainously distorted and defiled the truth-teaching since time immemorial in shamefulness (con-
           temptibility) and disputation (denial); do not allow the work of the prophets, the active ones in the truth-teach-
           ing, to rot and spoil or to become lost, whether man or woman, even if you are different from one another;
           do not flee from the truth and do not allow yourselves to be driven away from it by unrighteous ones (irre-
           sponsible ones) and unknowing ones, because truly it is the best homestead that you could have.
          242) And truly, those amongst you who fight in peace and freedom for the cause of the truth, you will find conso-
           nance (harmony) in your inner world (consciousness) and in your psyche, just as you will create a garden in
           your feelings and thoughts through which flow the rivers of joy, love and happiness, as the most beautiful
           reward for your loyalty to the wellspring of all creative (Creation) and its laws and recommendations.
          243) And let it be said to you again and again: Do not allow yourselves to be deceived by the wanderings and the
           false teachings of the truth-deniers in the land, but instead be watchful at all times and recognise their slan-
           ders (calumnies) and lies and their deception in the face of the real truth; however, if you do allow yourselves
           to be seduced, then you will only have a small and brief gain, because then the fire of depravity (hell) will take
           up its dwelling in you and devour you from within, so that you will no longer find a good place of rest in your-
           selves.
          244) Those amongst you, however, who fear the untruth and inequity (unfairness) and everything that is unright-
           eous (conscienceless), love and peace will reside in you as well as freedom and consonance (harmony), just as
           your reflexions will be joyfulness and happiness.
          245) And certainly there are some amongst you who would like to be connected to the truth-teaching, but you can-
           not find the way to it because you are entrapped in a belief in a god or tin god; truly, if you search for the way
           then you will find it but only if you approach the truth in an unbiased (neutral) wise and therefore without par-
           tiality (prejudice) and you fathom it without the blindness (fanaticism) of your false belief.
          246) And if you are truly searching for the way to the truth and to the teaching of the prophets, then do not reach
           for the truth submissively, but freely and victoriously in yourselves, and do not allow yourselves to be sold for
           a small price of belief by the believers in god and believers in tin gods so that you continue to follow the
           untruth and delusion of a fabulated (invented) god or tin god made up by people of your kind (human beings);
           and do not allow yourselves to continue to be seduced by false signs (false evidence) and pictures (images of
           gods/images of tin gods) and figures (cult statues/statues of gods/statues of tin gods) or entities (cult objects)
           of the priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of the god cults and tin god cults which are unsubstantiated
           (invented) by people of your kind (human beings).
          247) Those amongst you who are searching for the truth and the teaching of the prophets, or you who have al-
           ready found it, be open at all times to it and compete in the steadfastness of learning so that you may become
           more knowing and wiser and may lead your existence in accordance with the laws and recommendations of
           the Creation, and so that you may be continuously on your guard and afeared of the doings of those who deal
           with belief in gods and tin gods, so that it may go well with you.
