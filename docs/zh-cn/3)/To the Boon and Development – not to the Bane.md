# To the Boon and Development – not to the Bane

> The “Goblet of the Truth” you have now studied, have removed evil and
> untruths out of you, for your good, your honour and for the life, have
> given the truth its true value, the creational laws their right, shown
> your way to the peace and joy, and you have also learnt a great deal
> out of this book, and everything to your boon – not to the bane.
