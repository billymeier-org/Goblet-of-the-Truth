# Chapter 18
1) The ones truly having knowledge of the truth are like glittering stars in the firmament, because they are the
 reflection of the laws and recommendations as they have been given since the beginning of all unfolding (exis-
 tence) through the primordial eternality (Creation).
2) And the ones truly having knowledge of the truth and the ones truly following the truth are people of your
 kind (human beings), as they are also mighty helpers and leaders for all people of your kind (humankind) on
 the thorny way to finding the truth and following the truth, and they stand by you for obtaining the virtues in
 the best possible fullness of value.
3) And the ones truly having knowledge of the truth and the ones truly following the truth amongst people of
 your kind (human beings) are the proclaimers (prophets) who arise from your midst; and they possess the
 virtues in a good wise and practise them in right measure.
4) The proclaimers are victorious over themselves, because they have vanquished and defeated the evil powers of
 unfairness (irresponsibility) and of unrighteousness (consciencelessness) in themselves, and as a prize for their
 victory they have indeed attained many of the virtues; however, they do not assume to be set over you, rather
 they adjust themselves to people of your kind (human beings) in moderateness (modesty), so that you shall not
 recognise (see) them as anything more than you yourselves are.
5) Consider, however, that it is not through your wise of the leading of the life (life-conduct) in unfairness (irre-
 sponsibility) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness), as well as through doing nothing and through good
 living, that they become proclaimers (prophets), rather it is only through affliction and pain and through dan-
 ger that they become what they are, whereby their heads shine (they are well-versed in the knowledge of the
 truth).
6) And truly, not everyone amongst people of your kind (human beings) can be a proclaimer (prophet), because
 only the one who knows the laws and recommendations of the primordial eternality (Creation) in good mea-
 sure and can also master and follow them extensively (amply) can determine (select) themselves for this.
7) And if you people of your kind (human beings) wish to follow the proclaimer (prophet) then you must deter-
 mine (select) yourselves to do this and take a special way on which you disconnect (liberate) yourselves from
 all that is earthly, which binds you to the unrighteous (conscienceless) and the unfair (irresponsible); this alone
 is extensively (amply) the way of the selected (completed) observation (control) of the primal-eternal (cre-
 ational) laws and recommendations, from which true love and wisdom and high knowledge evolve, which are
 the highest good of the truthly proclaimer (prophet).
