# Chapter 23
1) Truly, at all times, you human beings of Earth have searched for something that extends far beyond what you
 call your material wellbeing – something that is the truthly truth and that can be called reality.
2) You see this reality as a timeless state, as something that cannot be affected in any kind and wise through any circumstances and therefore also not through your human thoughts and feelings or through your depravity.
3) This reality is the truthfulness of the Creation with its uncontrovertible laws and recommendations which you,
 human beings of Earth, raise up to a godhead in your unintellect, to which you pray and supplicate, without
 ever receiving a sign from it that it is responding to the supplicating, begging and praying, although this is
 hardly surprising because the godhead is of course only fantasifully thought up and invented, but is in every
 respect completely powerless and without might to do any things in the good or evil.
4) Continuously, since time immemorial, you have asked what it is that stands mightily over you and is the well-
 spring of all existence and BEING, and is called Creation.
5) And you ask yourselves whether there is actually any sense to the life because you are looking at the dignity-
 less chaos of your life, all the evil, the murdering and jealousy, the coarsenesses and torturing, the hatred in
 manifold forms, the crimes and criminality, all the terrorism as well as the splittings (different forms of opin-
 ions, views, etc.) proceeding out of the ideologies, religions, sects and philosophies and out of the politics of
 all nations which are continuously growing and apparently never cease.
6) And truly, it is understandable that you ask yourselves in deep disappointment what you shall do against it,
 what in truth is that which you call life, and whether this really goes beyond that which you call god.
7) The truth is that no such godhead exists, because that to which you pray and supplicate as god is only a fan-
 tasy-form invented through you human beings which cannot help you in any wise.
8) The truth is namely that only the Creation stands over you, and you are integrated into its laws and recom-
 mendations and into its effects.
9) However, neither the Creation nor its laws and recommendations determine what you have to do and not do, because that is left up to you through your will according to which you can determine and act as you wish.
10) It is therefore through your free will that you determine all and everything with regard to your life-conduct and
 your destiny, with no determinations whatsoever influencing you on the part of the Creation or on the part of
 its laws and recommendations.
11) Therefore, if you care for your thoughts and feelings and act according to your ideas and motivations, then
 this is done through your own responsibility which you alone must bear, without any involvement through the
 Creation or its laws and recommendations.
12) The only thing which comes forth out of the creational laws and recommendations are its effects which regu-
 late that from out of a distinct cause a thereout resulting effect arises.
13) And if you therefore ask what you can do for your life and against all the evil world-happenings through which
 you are disappointed, then the answer is found in that you must strive as individuals in every wise to achieve
 in yourselves true love as well as peace, freedom and harmony in order to carry these high values forth
 amongst your fellow human beings and throughout the whole world.
14) If you as humankind are to be changed to the better, then you must start with yourselves as individuals and
 reach for the creational laws and recommendations in order to fulfil them in yourselves; and, once you have
 fulfilled them on yourselves, it requires for you to live them outwardly, into the world around you, so that your
 fellow human beings can take you as an example, because truly it is only in this kind and wise that a change
 to the better can come about in a greater and great extent.
15) At the same time, it is not to be assumed that you as human beings could only be altered in whole or in part in your inner nature solely through the words of your fellow human beings, because none amongst you can
change another in any wise, since it is only the human being in question who can do this through his or her own endeavours, if they require a change of the inner nature and also want this.
16) Therefore, if there is to be an end to all the wars and crimes, the terrorism and hatred of all kinds, the jealousy
 and the criminality as well as the murdering and torture, the altercations, the outbreaks of anger and rage, and
 also an end to the acts of Gewalt of all kinds, the cheating and thievery, the human trafficking and the patho-
 logical cravings and vices and other terrible things of all kinds, then it is the individual who is called upon, and
 indeed in such a wise that individuals must first bring under control within themselves all the terrible things
 and their baleful thoughts and feelings and clear them up, in order to lead their lives in fairness and in full
 responsibility and conscientiousness.
17) However, what you are looking for with regard to the indescribable, which stands as true might over yourselves
 and over all existence and to which you give a thousand names, which, however, you name god in your delu-
 sion of belief, is truthly the Creation with its laws and recommendations, and you have always searched for
 these since time immemorial without being able to find them, because false prophets have guided you with
 false teachings into the unreal and to a belief in gods and tin gods, and thus into religious aberration and con-
 fusion.
18) The truthly prophets, however, who brought you the real truth, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life, it is those whom you have persecuted at all times and even to the present day,
 seeking to kill them; and you have cursed their teaching and calumniated their signs, their evidence which they
 gave to you as being magic and the work of the devil.
19) And it is mainly your servants of gods, your priests and the like who in no wise acknowledge and follow the
 truthly ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, because they only acknowledge their teachings of gods and curse the truth
 of the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› which is against the godly servile and irrational teachings and does not
 proclaim any godly ideals, such as the teachings of gods do, which could not be more confusing and more
 false.
20) And because the servants of gods believe and represent their false teachings of their false prophets and falsi-
 fiers of scrolls, therefore they, in their religiously deluded belief, invent lies about ideals that are far removed
 from reality, as well as about redeemers and paradises in godly heavens, which are devoid of all reality.
21) The worshippers of gods are directed towards religious belief-forms thought up by you human beings which
 are devoid of all reality and contradict and derisively mock all the truth of the Creation and of its laws and
 recommendations, which inevitably leads to differences in the understanding and following of the belief-forms
 through the believers, with the effect that every belief will inevitably lead to the Gewaltsamkeit in itself as well
 as to the extensive Gewaltsamkeit amongst all you human beings of Earth.
22) In the continuous battle which you call life, you attempt to create a codex of behaviour which shall correspond to your society, in which you grew up, and indeed irrespective of whether this is a so-called unfree or free society.
23) Fundamentally, you only accept a normalised life-attitude of your belief as a constituent part of your traditions
 and customs, which proceed from out of your cults, religions and sects, and so you always look for a godhead
 invented through you human beings who supposedly says to you what things you shall do that are rightful or
 shall leave that are unrightful.
24) You look to your godhead or to your tin god to see what they shall say to you, what your right or wrong behav-
 iour shall be and what your right thoughts and feelings shall be, and you then believe your priests and your
 other worshippers of gods, worshippers of tin gods who fabulate away or consciously lie about what their deity
 or their tin god have given as rules, although neither an invented god nor tin god can give any rules of behav-
 iour or any other rules and regulations of any kind, because they do not exist.
25) You, however, who are searching for the truth of all truth, you fall prey to the belief in your gods and tin gods
 and the false assertions and irrational teachings of the priests, therefore you direct yourselves according to the
 supposed norms of the supposed gods and tin gods, through which your behaviour as well as your thoughts
 and feelings become mechanical in terms of belief or religion, and your reactions become automatic due to
 being bound by belief, as a result of which you are no longer capable of free thoughts and feelings because
 they are only controlled through the belief and the religion.
26) If you would direct your interest to this fact, then you would recognise the truth and turn away from the belief
 and from the religions, but as you are captured in yourselves through your own religious belief, you are unable
 to break through your own prison and cannot get through to the outside in order to experience the effective
 truth of all truth, as is given through the Creation and its laws and recommendations.
27) Truly, for thousands of years, you human beings of Earth have been patronised through your teachers who have been misguiding you and through your authorities with false teachings and through false prophets, as
well as through many of your fellow human beings who have raised themselves to gods or representatives of
gods, to godly ambassadors as well as to leaders of religions and sects, and have written scripts and books about their irrational and false teachings.
28) And, for thousands of years, you have been believing these deceivers and charlatans, the false prophets, whereas
 you have been insulting the true prophets by calling them liars, calumniating them, persecuting them and striv -
 ing to kill them.
29) You believe the charlatans and deceivers, the false prophets as well as their priests and other servants of gods,
 and you expect from them that they can reveal everything to you which is the truthly truth and what is hid-
 den behind the truthly laws and recommendations of the life.
30) They, however, cannot give you any answer to this, because their knowledge is not built up on the creational
 truth, but rather on an unreal belief in a godhead or in tin gods and their cults and rites.
31) You however, you are satisfied with their false presentations and explanations, and you willingly let yourselves
 be guided into the unreal, and indeed without you yourselves searching for the fundamental truth of the life,
 because you are captured in a religious belief, which is your belief of the servitude.
32) Truly, you only live according to the misguiding words of your priests, who maintain that they are repeating
 the words of their god, which, however, truthly does not exist and, as an imaginary unreality, has neither the
 power to do good or evil.
33) And since you only live according to the misguiding and false words of your priests and supposed gods and
 tin gods, therefore your life is hollow and empty.
34) And because you do not determine over yourselves, but let yourselves be determined through your belief in
 imaginary gods and tin gods as well as through their priests and other worshippers of gods and worshippers
 of tin gods, therefore you are no more than human beings at second hand, because you only take from what
 is prescribed to you through the belief and what is said to you through the priests and worshippers of gods as
 well as worshippers of tin gods, without you truthly deciding for yourselves.
35) You are not using your intellect and your rationality in order to fathom out the truthly truth of the life through
 your own thoughts and feelings and to find it in the creational laws and recommendations, as they are mani-
 foldly also recognisable in the free nature.
36) And by leading your life in your belief in gods and tin gods, you do not let any true control prevail over your-
 selves and your doing as well as over your thoughts, feelings and deeds, rather you let yourselves be led simply
 uncontrolled through your intentions and inclinations as well as through your lustfulnesses and attitudes, as
 well as through what is forcefully imposed upon you though the circumstances and through your fellow
 human beings or through the environment.
37) Therefore you are not the result of yourselves, but rather the result of many and manifold influences that con-
 tinuously break in upon you, in particular influences that result out of your belief in your invented gods and
 tin gods.
38) In you, there is only the long-standing belief in your deities and tin gods, however nothing new, nothing that
 you have discovered yourselves, and nothing that you discover yourselves, because you are truly empty and
 hollow with regard to the truthly knowledge about the reality of the Creation and of its laws and recommen-
 dations, therefore there is nothing original and nothing primeval in you – only belief in a fabulated god or tin
 god.
39) Truly, since time immemorial, since the entire religious past, you human beings of Earth have been irrationally
 taught and assured through religious or sectarian teachers, and you continue to be taught irrationally and as-
 sured that you, providing you undertake cult activities such as rites and sacrifices as well as repeating certain
 prayers or mantras, will receive enlightenment and a propitious existence.
40) And it has been and is said to you that it is necessary that you shall suppress your needs and wishes, and that
 you shall adapt yourselves to certain norms and control your thoughts as well as purify your passions and raise
 them into higher levels, so you shall be god-pleasing.
41) And, furthermore, it has been and continues to be said to you through the religions that you shall restrain your
 drives and refrain from sexual debaucheries so that your ‹spirit› and your body will be purified.
42) And, as has been and continues to be religiously taught to you, it is only when your ‹spirit› and body are suf- ficiently tortured that you shall find a higher life, which is only to be found beyond the meaningless earthly life.
43) And truly, so-called religious human beings amongst you, numbering in the millions, have done in this wise
 over the past hundreds and thousands of years, and many amongst you human beings of Earth still do so
 equally today, however without success as always since time immemorial.
44) As your forefathers before you, you go into the seclusion, into monasteries, into the quiet cell, into the moun-
 tains, into the forest, into a cave, into the desert or you go begging through the world, alone or in groups, in
 order to force your consciousness (erroneously called ‹spirit›) to join into a belief and to adapt itself to an un-
 reality thought up through you human beings.
45) But, truly, through that you are merely going even more astray in the irrational teachings and in the belief in
 gods and tin gods and the like, because the more you do this, the deeper you fall into the darkness of the not-
 knowing and the untruth.
 46) Consider, human beings of Earth, what you are doing in this wise makes you into tormented human beings
 with a broken consciousness, broken thoughts and feelings and a broken psyche.
47) In this wise, you truly cannot escape from the tumult of the world-happenings, even if you strive to do so,
 because if you attempt to abdicate the outside world through such discipline and through that to adapt your-
 selves to your belief and its requirements and expectations, then you will only be insensitive against the truth
 and reality, and furthermore, no matter how long you may strive and struggle, you will only ever find what cor-
 responds to your misguided thoughts and feelings and therefore to your delusions.
48) Truthly, a completely different way must be taken if you want to find and discover those things on the other
 side of the tumult of the world and of the angstful and ambitious, fear-filled as well as guiltful and nervous
 life which contain higher values, which, however, has nothing to do with illusory enlightenments and fabu-
 lated, godly spheres and unrealities of being, but rather solely and alone with the effective truth of reality.
49) Fundamentally, you human beings of Earth must go into yourselves in order to acquire everything in yourselves
 by you creating true love in yourselves as well as inner peace, inner freedom and harmony.
50) If, in doing so, you give up all lovelessness, all unpeace as well as all disharmony and unfreedom by which you are bound, and if you practise the status of equalisedness and neutrality in yourselves, then over the course of
time an inner blossoming of that inner love and beauty will arise which opens the entire life in full magnificence.
51) You, however, human beings of Earth, you are in reality doing precisely the opposite and therefore everything
 in order to be narrow-minded, loveless, inferior and unsignificant.
52) If you are fathoming out your true core, if you are peeling away layer by layer, then you take your time in doing
 so, although you are filled with expectations that you will find goodness in yourselves, as you also hope that
 the next morning or your next life will bring good things for you – but when you then finally reach the centre
 of the core of your inner nature then you discover with dread that there is nothing in there but emptiness or
 rubbish because you could not put anything valueful into it since your consciousness has been left dormant
 and you have made your thoughts and feelings blunt, incapable and unconcerned through a belief in a god
 or tin god.
53) But it is only when this discovery has been made that you ask yourselves whether there might not be a dif-
 ferent way leading to the effective truth rather than the belief in a god or tin god, so that you can neverthe-
 less still break through from the centre of your inner nature to the real truth.
54) Unfortunately, you and the bulk of the world accept and follow the traditional way which is that of the reli-
 gious belief in a god or tin god, because of which the true reality is not recognised.
55) If you, human beings of Earth, honestly fathom out the truthly cause of the chaos in yourselves, then you will recognise that this cause is the search for a false reality which has been promised to you by false prophets and
false teachers as well as by priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods since time immemorial.
56) Therefore, you mechanically follow the irrational teachings which assure you a beneficial ‹spiritual› life, but you
 can never achieve this because you do not turn to the creational truth of all truth, but instead only ever to a
 religious belief in an invented god or tin god which are without energy or power.
57) Truly, you human beings of Earth, if you consider the highest peculiarity that you oppose any religious, sectar-
 ian, political or private tyranny and any dictatorship or any other power if it is directed against you yourselves
 and you become aware of it, whereas inwardly you accept the authority, tyranny and dictatorship of another
 if it is directed against one or more of you human beings or against an entire people; truly, your consciousness
 and your behaviour are also confused in this direction, because you are not capable of clear intellect, and also
 not of clear rationality.
58) It is also peculiar if you repudiate – and not intellectually but rather in reality – the so-called ‹spiritual› author-
 ity, and therefore also the religious belief, as well as the dogmas, rituals, ceremonies and other cult activities,
 so that you then suddenly stand alone amongst all the religious believers who regard you as ones who have
 got very badly out of the control of the good human nature and are outcasts, because of which you firstly find
 yourselves in conflict with the believers and secondly also with the priests and other higher worshippers of gods
 and tin gods, and further also with society itself.
59) If you distance yourselves from the religious belief then you are ones who have got very badly out of the con-
 trol of the good human nature, outcasts or ‹godless ones› in the eyes of the society, and therefore human
 beings to whom no more esteem is shown, nevertheless, also this is no stumbling block for you to continue
 wallowing in the false religious belief rather than turning to the effective and real truth of all truth, to the truth
 of the Creation and its laws and recommendations.
60) However, you want to be esteemed human beings in the society, but through this you cannot find the way to
 the real truth of the creational laws and recommendations, and it is also impossible for you to come nearer to
 the endless and unmeasurable reality.
 61) You cowardly accept the truth-unknowledge against the truthly truth of all truth of the Creation and of its laws
 and recommendations, in order to have a certain standing in the society and to profit from this standing in one
 or another kind and wise.
62) Truly, you are ruled by cowardice and you bow down in anxiety and fear of the harsh rule of religion, what-
 ever it may be, and indeed only because you, in your pusillanimousness and chickenheartedness, are unable
 to bring forth the courage to be yourselves, to promote in yourselves your own thoughts of the rationality and
 intellect in order to let the effective truth be granted to yourselves and to turn away from the untruth of the
 religious belief in a godhead or in a tin god.
63) But truly, you human beings of Earth, you are peculiar because if you have begun to turn away from the tra-
 ditional way of the religious belief and therefore to negate all the false things, then you create a reaction out
 of this refusal of the god-related or tin god-bound religiosity, and this reaction is based on you acquiring an-
 other pattern of a god or tin god and falling prey to another religious or sectarian belief which holds you just
 as tightly with its greedy clutches as the belief that you previously had and from which you have turned away;
 therefore, you, human beings of Earth, simply turn from one religious belief to the next, without thereby reach-
 ing the way of the real truth of all truth, namely to the effective truth of the Creation and of its laws and
 recommendations.
64) If you turn away from a religious belief in a godhead or in a tin god or the like, no matter of what kind, because
 your intellect and your rationality tell you that it is good and right, then you nevertheless do not get any fur-
 ther and do not find the truthly truth if you make nothing out of the rejection of the belief, but simply turn to
 another belief.
65) However, if you reject the false, the religious belief in a god or tin god, in a human being who has elevated him-
 self or herself into a god or god-representative, in saints, angels and demons, because you recognise that each
 religious or other belief is merely made out of a blunt consciousness, and if you understand the immaturity of
 the social and religious accords and rules of conduct and repudiate these on the basis of deep insight because
 you are continuously becoming freer in yourselves when you turn to the real truth, then on the one hand you
 will be free of the uncalmness in yourselves, whereas on the other hand you will bring forth uncalmness
 amongst your fellow human beings because you are no longer of their enslaving religious belief.
66) You human beings of Earth, however, who free yourselves from your religious belief in a god or tin god, in a
 human being who has raised himself or herself up to the representative of god, and from the belief in saints,
 angels, demons or also from the human idols of all kinds, and who finally become yourselves and also carry all
 the responsibility for yourselves, you will escape out of the greedy clutches of the traditional characterlessness
 and indecency which are taught to you by the society and by the religions, and which are characterlessly pre-
 sented as honourableness.
67) And when you get this far then you will discover that you must no longer search for the effective truth of all
 truth, because searching is fundamentally wrong, since this is the equivalent to a hunt for something undeter-
 minate which is never found because it is not known and also cannot be found.
68) Therefore it is necessary to learn, not to search, but rather to use rationality and intellect in order to recognise
 the truthly truth of all truth there, where it actually is, and no actual searching is required for this but only a
 perception of all things that go on, take place and move around you human beings of Earth, because the
 modes of functioning of the creational laws and recommendations and therefore the effective truth are to be
 recognised therein, which only require the intellect and rationality and the to-be-created will for it to be under-
 stood and followed.
69) The truthly truth can be perceived and recognised in the free nature all around, so, how it manifests itself as the effects of the creational laws and recommendations in all and everything, and therefore also in you human
beings yourselves as well as in every plant and in every life form, and equally so in the elements of Earth and
in the entire universe, in the stars, the planets, the meteors, the shooting stars and the comets and nebulae.
70) Truly, the effective truth that lies in the creational laws and recommendations as well as in the Creation itself
 can never be shown as such through priests, books, philosophers, servants of gods, redeemers, prophets, ideo-
 logues or other human beings, just as the questions about it cannot be either.
71) However, it is a fact that the mode of functioning of the truth and therefore also the modes of functioning of
 the creational laws and recommendations can be named, although this does not belong in the explanation-
 domain of those who place a god above themselves and pray to it, just as all those caught up in religion of
 any kind do, such as priests, servants of gods, philosophers, redeemers and the like who stay far away from
 the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and therefore far from the ‹Teaching
 of the Prophets› in which everything that is known with regard to the truthly truth and mode of functioning
 of the creational laws and recommendations is proclaimed.
72) And the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, only names the facts of the truth which run
 through the entire life and form the guidelines of the existence which you human beings of Earth shall follow
 so that you may lead a good and life-pleasing existence, valuing and esteeming it highly.
 73) The teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life of the true prophets teaches you
 in accordance with the cognitions proceeding out of the creational laws and recommendations, all those things
 that you require for a true and fair as well as conscientious and responsible life-conduct, so that true love and
 harmony may exist in you yourselves as well as amongst your entire humankind, as well as truthly freedom and
 all-embracing peace.
74) And if you follow the teaching, the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, and if you learn every-
 thing which it imparts you, then you shall not simply accept everything as given, but rather use it in order to
 fathom it out and to work it out in yourselves, so that you may find the real truth out of and in everything,
 and become knowing and wise in yourselves by understanding and following the truth that you have found
 in yourselves.
75) Consider also, you human beings of Earth, only what you have created in yourselves through hard working-
 out and truth-finding through the explanations and guidance of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life and all that which you perceive in the free nature all around in all things and life
 forms and recognise as effects of the creational laws and recommendations, can you find in yourselves as effec-
 tive truth if you consciously and honestly strive to do so.
76) Therefore, it is a fact that no one can answer the question about the truthly truth for you themselves, not even
 the true prophets, because these can only guide you in the explanations of the truth as well as the modes of
 functioning of the creational laws and recommendations, whereas you can only find the truth for this in your-
 selves if you think through everything neutrally in yourselves and find the result of the truth therein.
77) But consider, when you want to find the truth in yourselves, and this is the only way to the truthly truth, then
 you shall not be immature in yourselves and you must therefore know yourselves so that you can understand
 yourselves, which in turn must be obtained through self-cognition.
78) If, therefore, you turn to the ‹Teaching of the Prophets› then you do not need to search for any kind of ‹higher
 things› or for ‹redemption› or for any other thing based in irrational teachings, but solely and exclusively learn
 out of the teaching only those things which lead you to the self-cognition and to your own self and to all those
 characterly and virtuous values through which you can raise yourselves up to the being human in the real and
 true sense; and it is only once you have acquired certain values in this regard and have found your own self
 that you shall turn to those things of the teaching through which you make valueful perceptions and deeper
 cognitions and cognisances as well as win deeper knowledge and practical experience which you feel as living-
 experience and can use as wisdom.
79) And if you ask yourselves what your self is, then you must fathom your inner nature and its individuality in
 order to be able to observe that there is a great difference between this individuality, i.e. the character of your
 inner nature and you human beings as such, i.e. as individuums.
80) You human beings as individuums with your own will and your own decisions are more or less free, not bound
 to one place and you can be anywhere you like and love, such as in a place, in a country, or you can belong
 to a quite distinct society, culture and religion, can dedicate yourselves to your activity and use everything
 which is of material kind and in this wise determines your life as a human being; however, your individuality is
 bound as character in your nature as a local oneness, and gives expression of itself with its especialness, pecu-
 liarities as well as with the character, the virtues and with the personality, etc.
81) And your deeds as an individuum, as a human being, are only partly related to the whole and broad life-area
 which not only includes the human being as an individuum with his or her free choice of the dwelling, soci-
 ety, culture and religion or his or her mode of thinking, but also the individual which has inherent in itself the
 especialness, character, virtues and personality and, of course, also the human and the being human in the real
 and true sense; what arises out of this is that individuum and individuality are two fundamentally different val -
 ues which are often confounded with each other and wrongly explained by you human beings of Earth.
82) Therefore, in this connection, it is always necessary to take the whole into account, therefore it is not possible
 to speak of only one part, because in truth it is always a matter of the completeness of you human beings,
 namely the individuum and the individuality which are decisive with regard to the being human in the real and
 true sense; and because only the completeness of individuum and individuality is important, out of this it also
 follows that both parts are of equal importance and of equal value, therefore there is no smaller and larger
 part, and therefore it is wrong to teach that a smaller and a larger part arise with regard to the individuality
 and the individuum, meaning that the larger cannot be found in the smaller and the smaller cannot be found
 in the larger, because truthly, both parts of the wholeness individuum and individuality are of equal value, just
 as the one part draws benefit from the other; therefore it is necessary to remember always to talk about the
 whole and not about a part, and that the same values are found in both parts, but are simply of a different
 kind in their form, namely as material and intrinsic, i.e. as individuum-based and individual.
 83) As individuum, you human beings of Earth are constrained creatures who bring misery on yourselves and are
 disappointed as well as still powerless with regard to the consciousness and of little significant importance,
 who satisfy yourselves with your false religious belief and your invented little gods and tin gods and images,
 and live according to your old confused and irrational traditions, whereas you could however live as true
 human beings if you built up your inner nature, your individuality, in a truthly wise according to the creational
 laws and recommendations and would transfer this to your entire life in yourselves and outside of yourselves;
 in doing so, you would then also be true human beings in humaneness, in which you would participate in the
 well-being, in all affliction, in the misery and confusion of your entire earthly humankind.
84) But truly, you human beings of Earth, you have remained captives of yourselves and of your traditions for many
 thousands and even millions of years, traditions which you have learned and followed through lies and decep-
 tions of your fellow human beings who invented gods and tin gods and more of the same with fantasy or with
 a confused consciousness, and you have accepted these gods and tin gods and have since then worshipped
 them and begged them for help, however, they can never give you anything because they are only imaginary
 and powerless figures of fantasy.
85) And false duties have been imposed upon you through the inventors of the fantasy-forms, god and tin god,
 and false prophets have given false teachings as well as false requirements of the supposed gods and tin gods
 the fulfilment of which has been imposed upon you as a duty, out of which however only terribleness arose,
 which came entirely upon your whole humankind in the form of greed and envy, jealousy, hatred, anxiety, fear
 and despair, aggression, pathological craving for revenge, lustfulnesses, pathological craving for retaliation,
 which has, through getting very badly out of the control of the good human nature, entirely turned into war,
 terror, pathological craving for might as well as religious fanaticism and into the religious belief-delusion from
 which there is no rescue.
86) Sometimes, however, you also feel joy, love and inclination in yourselves, but you are also doubtful in this and therefore an exceedingly peculiar mixture of love and hatred, of jealousy and inclination, of forbearance and
unforbearance, of honesty and unhonesty as well as of kindheartedness and evil, also of pathological craving
for revenge and reconciliation, of peaceableness and peacelessness and of acting with Gewalt and charity, etc.
87) Truly, as far as technology is concerned, you human beings of Earth have made great progress; from the club
 to the atom bomb and from the wheelless cart to space rockets, you have pushed ahead with your progress,
 but in your inner nature, in your individuality, you have not developed greatly as an individuum, as a human
 being, but have negatively changed yourselves even further, by means of which you have created the entire
 unhonest structure of the society throughout the world.
88) When you look at and consider the external social structure, then you see the result of your inner psychologi-
 cal structure as is given in your inner nature, i.e. in your individuality which you carry in you as an individuum,
 as a human being, as the expression of your attitude, because as an individuum you use the result of the entire
 practical experiences, of the entire knowledge and of all things in order to form your individual, i.e. natural
 behaviour, as you have done already since time immemorial, which is why you carry therewith the entire past
 in your inner nature, i.e. in your individuality.
89) You as human beings, as individuums, are the expression which carries your entire humankind in it as individ-
 uality, as an inner nature, because it is in the inner nature, in the individuality, that everything has been formed
 since time immemorial, and namely the entire sorrowful and inadequate evolution-history, through the wrong
 use of the consciousness and of the thoughts and feelings, through which the inner nature, the individuality,
 has been impaired and deformed, and this is transferred to the outside as well, to you human beings as indi-
 viduums.
90) Pay attention to what is happening in yourselves, in your inner nature, i.e. in your individuality, as well as what
 you as a human being, individuum, are doing outwardly, and what is generally taking place in your outer world
 in which you live and which is a culture of competition without parallel, which only demands might, posses-
 sions and riches, pleasure, influence, position, rank and name as well as prestige and everything that stands
 somehow or other in material connection.
91) And look at and consider everything of which you are proud and which you vehemently fight for; look at and
 consider however also your relationships that you lead which are full of conflicts and jealousy, as well as full of
 hatred, ausgeartet passion and fanaticism, out of which brutality results as well as strife, terror, murder and
 manslaughter and war.
92) Truly, that is your life, human beings of Earth, as you have known it since time immemorial, because you do
 not understand the truth of the creational laws and recommendations and you are incapable of truly under-
 standing and controlling the gigantic struggle of the life.
93) Truly, hatred and strife, jealousy, greed for might, belief and worshipping gods, brutality, murder and man- slaughter, endless wars and other terror as well as torture, missing interhuman relationships, greed, vice and
all kinds of pathological cravings are things which you undertake to an excessive extent, and this extensive
domain of the evil and Ausartung is everything that you know; naturally, your are afraid of all this and you
search for hidden possibilities to escape all these terrible things, but you do not succeed because you only turn
 to your material life and to all its things, and however not to the truthly truth of all truth which is only to be
 found in the creational laws and recommendations, but which is unknown to you, however.
94) Therefore you are afraid of the unknown, of the life and of the death and of everything that lies behind the
 next morning and in the near and far future; but you are also afraid of what is known to you, which the present
 existence brings you, and that is truly your life in which there is no confidence for you if you do not finally be -
 think yourselves in order to turn to the truthly truth of all truth as is taught to you through the creational laws
 and recommendations, explained through the true prophets in the book ‹Goblet of the Truth›, the ‹Teaching
 of the Prophets›, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
95) Human beings of Earth, consider the truthly truth of all truth and learn it so that you recognise that all reli-
 gions and all their terms of any kind, as well as all philosophies, ideologies and all forms of the religious belief
 in gods and tin gods as well as their like are nothing more than a cowardly flight from the true reality and there-
 fore from that which is truthly and uncontrovertible; and through the cowardly flight from the real truth and
 the effective reality, which are pre-given through the creational laws and recommendations, you have brought
 wars and all kinds of terribleness over your world and humankind.
96) You have created vast changes in your world and in your humankind since time immemorial and up into the
 present time, although the majority of all these upheavals have been and are also in the present time of an
 extremely negative and evil nature, and indeed through your hatred that you bear towards your fellow human
 beings because you do not like their nose, their religion or their strangeness or whatever else, through which
 you see yourselves incited to practice jealousy, take the first opportunity to wage wars and other terror, start
 reformations, revolutions and bloody demonstrations and riots.
97) And you create ideologies, religions, sects, laws, regulations and ordinances which are unworthy of you human
 beings and which unavoidably lead to confusion and wars, because they are laws, regulations and ordinances
 which take from you human beings the dignity, peace, freedom and harmony in every wise and only bring
 forth more and more terrible things amongst you instead of them being able to change you as individuals and
 as a whole society fundamentally to the better.
98) As human beings which you are, you live in a monstrous world that you have created with ugly laws, ordi-
 nances and regulations, etc. that are directed towards a society of the brutality, of the anxiety and fear, of the
 terror, of the acts of Gewalt and of the unhonest competition; and this monstrous world with you as human-
 kind cannot come to rest and cannot become a world of love, peace and harmony as well as of true freedom
 for as long as you do not form everything amply to the good and according to the creational laws and recom-
 mendations, and indeed not only as an imagination and as a hope, but in truth and reality.
99) And only if you change yourselves in truth and reality to the good and better, and thereby your consciousness
 awakes to a new freshness, reforms itself and becomes pure, will it be possible for you to bring forth an entirely
 different and valueful world in which you then live in a true paradise and you feel well, and you are filled with
 love and are also surrounded by it, as also peace, freedom and harmony will prevail in and outside you.
100) However, this can only happen if every single one of you human beings of Earth as a single individuum be-
 comes conscious of the important fact, and acts according to it, namely that you are yourselves as fully all
 around responsible as individuals for the entire status of your own inner nature, i.e. your individuality as well
 as for the evolution of your consciousness and with regard to your actions and efforts, as each individual of
 you is also fully and completely responsible for the status of the world in its entirety, irrespective of where you
 may live and to which social class, religion or sect, which people, which culture, which philosophy or ideology
 you belong to as individuals.
101) Be clearly conscious – even if you vehemently deny it and believe that you are not guilty – that every single one
 of you is responsible for each war and each act of terror and for each other act of Gewalt, indeed even if you
 do not advocate it; and you are guilty of it because you do not do anything against it and you do not oppose
 it in any reasonable and logical wise in gewaltsamer Gewaltlosigkeit; you are only innocent of the whole thing
 if you do whatever is possible for you to take measures against all the terrible things, the wars, the terror and
 the acts of Gewalt, whether through spoken words, through speeches and lectures or through the script,
 because if you do this then do it according to law and right within the frame of the creational laws and recom-
 mendations to which each war and other terror and all acts of Gewalt stand in contradiction.
102) Human beings of Earth, you are full of aggressivity and are not connected to humankind, but rather you are nationalistic and racialistic as well as full of selfishness, full of conceit, ideals and prejudices, and you have your
titles and your riches, as well as your gods and tin gods and human idols and your belief in them, therefore
you adore them, worship them and make entreaties to them, and all this separates you from one another.
103) Truly, you must clearly recognise, and indeed through intellect and rationality, that you are yourselves respon- sible for all the terrible things surrounding you and for the entire chaos in you and in your world, for all the
affliction and for all the misery in yourselves as well as in the entire world; and you yourselves contribute to making everything even worse because you do not restrict your offspring, but rather continue to reproduce irresponsibly, through which all terrible things, the misery and the affliction as well as the gigantic catastrophes also continue to multiply in the world and in its nature, as do also the hatred, the jealousy, the wars, the ter- ror, the acts of Gewalt and crimes, etc. amongst you.
104) Finally recognise, you human beings of Earth, that you yourselves have contributed to all the terrible things of
 your world through your daily life, and are contributing further, because you are, as part of the monstrous
 earthly society, complicit in and responsible for everything, for the human dignitylessnesses, for the hatred, for
 the jealousy, for the death penalty, for the wars, acts of terror and crimes of all kinds, for all the misery and
 affliction, for all the brutality, acts of Gewalt and ugliness, for the greed, vices and pathological cravings,
 debauchery and all other Ausartungen; only when you finally recognise this fact and look round for the real
 truth of all truth, and find it in the creational laws and recommendations and follow it, only then will you finally
 act rightly and do everything for the best of yourselves and of your world.
105) However, it is not easy for you human beings to do the right thing in order to build up in yourselves, in your
 inner nature, a completely different individuality which raises you up in the consciousness and shows you
 things of the life which are of such high values that you never could have dreamed of; and if you create a new
 individuality in your inner nature, then also let it act outwardly, by means of which a completely different and
 new world builds up around you, as well as valueful interhuman relationships come about, and love, harmony,
 peace and freedom amongst all of you.
106) The doing in this wise is a very serious matter, but you will not find out by yourselves what you must do in
 order to achieve everything and to direct the whole into solid, better and good forms, and precisely out of this
 reason have human beings arisen amongst you who have worked themselves up to ones having knowledge,
 wise ones and to proclaimers, to prophets, by finding out and learning the causes and effects of the nature
 and of the creational laws and recommendations, in order to teach you about the knowledge won, so that you
 might recognise the truthly laws and recommendations of creational form and put them into practice in the
 life, so that it may go well with you.
107) The true prophets, the proclaimers of the truth, they are your true leaders, you human beings of Earth, because
 they know and understand the creational laws and recommendations better than you, however truly they can
 only teach and explain these to you because learning and acquiring them in yourselves through rationality and
 intellect is something that you alone must do, and in fact out of free will and without the urgings of the
 prophets; the true prophets, namely, may only teach you, but not urge you to accept their teaching, because
 this would be the equivalent of a coercion to the belief, and through a coercion to the belief you would learn
 nothing and not find the truth in yourselves, rather you would only become the pattern of a new belief, with-
 out finding the truthly truth of all truth in yourselves and in the creational laws and recommendations.
108) And there have been and still are many so-called spiritual leaders and false prophets in your world, of whom you have assumed and continue to assume that they understand the things of the truth better than you, but
truthly they have said and continue to say this only because they have attempted and also continue to attempt
to make you subserviently dependent on them and on their false teaching, and to press you into their false
teaching as a pattern; and truly, this has not brought you very far even since time immemorial, and will also in
the future not bring you further than that you erroneously pray and make entreaties, as you have up until now,
to your gods and tin gods as well as to your human idols, from whom you will however never receive real help.
109) And there have been and still are many worldly-wise ones and academics since time immemorial whose wis-
 doms regarding spiritual and godly concerns have up to the present day not brought you human beings of
 Earth further, because their spirituality and godliness indeed does not correspond to the truth of the Creation
 and its laws and recommendations, but is only based on inventions and fantasies which have been invented
 through the worldly-wise and academics.
110) The worldly-wise and academics as well as the spiritual leaders and false prophets have lied to you and alleged
 that all ways were directed to lead to the truth, irrespective of whether you are believers of a religion or sect
 or whether you belong to a philosophy or ideology, but this is complete nonsense, because the only way to
 the truth leads through the inner of you human beings yourselves, since it is only and exclusively there that
 you can find the effective truth as is pre-given through the Creation and its laws and recommendations; how-
 ever, you cannot find the truth through lies and deception, nor through gods and tin gods, nor through reli-
 gions, sects, philosophies and ideologies.
111) No way leads to the real truth of all truth, because the truth itself is the way and thus the way is also the cul-
 mination-point, namely the truth itself, and it is only out of this reason that the way of the truth is spoken of
 which in itself leads to the truth, and it is precisely in this that the vitality of the truth consists.
112) If you look at and consider something lifeless, then a way leads to it which you can follow because everything
 that has died makes no movement and remains in a particular place or location, in contrast to the way of the
 truth which is vital and in movement.
 113) However, because the truth is something vital and in continuous movement, it is not bound to one place and
 neither is it bound to a restricted religious or other belief, as well as not to a gods- or tin gods-house.
114) Neither a spiritual leader, a religion, a holy man, an ideologue nor a priest, sect guru or a teacher can lead you
 to the continuously moving truth, because the truth is no material place such as a church, synagogue, chapel,
 mosque, lodge or temple, etc., because the effective, the truthly truth is solely in yourselves as well as in the
 Creation and in its laws and recommendations.
115) And because the truth as way and culmination-point is vital and is continuously in motion in you yourselves,
 this means that the truth unstoppably extends and moves further in you, therefore you do not remain lying on
 a particular truth, rather it continues to expand more and more through your research, and as a result it grows
 in you and you become ever more knowing and wise, this in contrast to the religious belief which is a firmly
 defined and non-expandable, unprovable and refutable illusion which is poor both in terminology and argu-
 ment, and is based on pretences of false facts.
116) Truly, you human beings of Earth, you do not live according to the love of the Creation, just as you do not cre-
 ate the true love in yourselves, and therefore you live your own life according to the pre-given of your own
 scheme. in which anxiety and fear of many things inhere, as however also anger and brutality, Gewaltsamkeit,
 violence and strife, hatred, jealousy, pathological craving for revenge, pathological craving for retaliation, coarse-
 ness, affliction, tribulation and despair, etc.
117) Already when you have recognised and understood this fact will you comprehend a tiny iota of the real truth
 in yourselves, but you can only recognise and understand this truth providing you know how to look at these
 things which belong to your life; and it is the true prophets who teach you human beings this mode of look -
 ing, through the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
118) And truly, you can only look at the truth with the truth itself, not however with anxieties and fear, not with
 hopes and not with a religious belief, as well as not through a veil of lying words of false teachers and false
 prophets, and also not with philosophies and ideologies, because if you want to experience the real truth then
 you must not be dependent on anybody or anything, but only bestir yourselves according to your own will and
 interest in absolutely your own energy and power, and turn to the truth that you can only find in yourselves
 as well as in the creational laws and recommendations.
119) Therefore, consider that you shall only ever be yourselves and that there is no teacher, no leader, no guru, no
 master, no prophet and also no other authority through which you might find the truth, because only you can
 do this all alone in yourselves, because truly, in this case there is only you all alone who must work in yourselves
 and find the truth.
120) Even the true prophets cannot give you the truth or show you a way to the truth, because for yourselves you
 alone are capable of fathoming out the truth in yourselves and also finding it and living according to it, because:
 none of you can change another, because the one who must change can only do this from out of himself or
 herself and on his or her own.
121) And if you recognise this truth then you shall not fall into despair because of it, since nevertheless you stand
 in a relationship to your fellow human beings and to the world, therefore there is no reason for you to let ei-
 ther bitterness or cynicism grow in you.
122) Nevertheless, however, the truth demands that you look the facts in the eye, namely that you are yourselves
 responsible for all and everything with regard to the thoughts and feelings that you harbour, the actions that
 you commit and the deeds that you do.
123) Only you are responsible for the world and for yourselves, for everything that you think up and do, and you
 must become conscious of this in order to make disappear your self-pity through which you criticise your fel-
 low human beings, insulting them, reproaching them, nagging them and tormenting them, because through
 that you believe to be covering up your self-pity.
124) Human beings of Earth, you must be yourselves in every wise and therefore you yourselves must also deter-
 mine over yourselves, so also over your thoughts, feelings, actions and your efforts, so that you may not be
 dependent on anybody and be the true might over yourselves, free from gods and tin gods and their servants
 who subjugate, enslave and exploit you.
125) And it is truly the truth that you can, without any outward influence, without authorities and without coer -
 cion, as well as without anxiety or fear of punishment, build up in the core of your inner nature a new individ-
 uality, a new speciality with a renewal and positive expansion of your character and your personality, providing
 you consciously revolutionise your old characteristics and bring forth a psychological developmental change
 out of your own power.
126) And if you bring forth the developmental change in yourselves then you will no longer be ones who have got very badly out of the control of the good human nature, no longer full of anxiety, brutality, jealousy and fear,
neither full of greed, vice and hatred of all kinds, neither full of violence, pathological craving for war, patho- logical craving for revenge, pathological craving for retaliation, crimes and quarrelsomeness, nor full of uncalm- ness, envy and desires, etc.
127) Truly, all these Ausartungen are not pre-given through the creational laws and recommendations, therefore
 they are also not expression-forms of your nature, but rather an evil machination of yourselves, through which
 you have also built up your worldwide rotten society in which you inevitably have to live and in which your
 daily existence takes place; and indeed for as long as you fail to turn to the real truth and therefore fail to fol-
 low extensively the laws and recommendations of creational form; because everything will only change to the
 better if you bind yourselves as individuals and as society with the real truth and therefore with the nature and
 thus also with the creational laws and recommendations.
128) Understand, human beings of Earth, that the ‹Teaching of the Prophets›, the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, the teach-
 ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, is no ideology and no philosophy, neither
 is it a religious construction of confusing terms and irrational ideas; therefore, however, the teaching does not
 require a belief nor any praying and entreaties to gods and tin gods or to human beings who raise themselves
 up to tin gods.
129) Ideologies, philosophies and religions are belief-conditioned theories which, as exceedingly foolish guidances
 into the unreal, have nothing to do with the effective truth and with the effects of the creational laws and
 recommendations.
130) What is important in your life is, without doubt, not false religions, ideologies and philosophies, but rather that
 you consciously observe and perceive everything round and about you, and indeed everything that arises day-in
 and day-out and actually in yourselves, everything negative and positive, everything agreeable and disagreeable,
 as well as everything that happens to your fellow human beings and throughout the entire world.
131) And if you follow this guidance and you observe everything precisely and actually perceive everything and
 examine what goes on within you and outside you, then you can also understand it rationally and intellectu-
 ally.
132) Rationality and intellect, however, do not fully encompass everything that your existence presents to you, rather
 they are only small parts of the whole, and you must put these together in order to finally have a oneness, a
 whole.
133) All things, therefore, which you comprehend are only small parts of the life, and indeed irrespective of how
 discerningly, venerably and traditionally these things of life may be put together as individual values or un-
 values; it is you yourselves, however, who must put everything together into a whole, because it is only through
 this that you can reach the highest level of your understanding and your evolution, if you concern yourselves
 with the whole.
134) It is only when you recognise what is going on in yourselves as well as in your fellow human beings and in the
 entire world in detail that you can start to understand that the inner and outer process is fundamentally an
 equal one.
135) The inner and outer process of development represents an all-embracing movement, where the movement of
 your inner is reflected in the outer, and the outer is reflected in your inner.
136) And truly, you human beings of Earth, you only need to consciously make yourselves capable of looking at
 everything just as amply and consciously and perceiving it just as consciously, because that and how you look
 is the fundamental necessity to which you must give your attention.
137) Consider, if you know how you have to look at the things of the life and perceive them, then everything will
 become entirely clear and precise for you, and you will recognise that all that is required in order to look at
 and to perceive is merely your own motivation and merely your own will as well as your own initiative, however
 no ideology, no religion and no philosophy, as well as no teacher, priest, no gods and tin gods and of course
 no human idols and neither false nor true prophets, because only you alone through yourselves can determine
 over yourselves and over what you want to do or not do.
138) Truly, no one can say to you how you need to look and to perceive, therefore the true prophets do not say to
 you either how you shall look and perceive, but only that you shall look and perceive, because you are, as an
 individuum, as a human being, each of your own individuality, through which you alone can determine how,
 when and where you want to look at something and also how you want to perceive it.
139) And if you strive to look at and perceive all things as they are in reality, and indeed both in yourselves and also
 in the world around you, amongst your fellow human beings and throughout the entire world, then you can
 really see what corresponds to the reality and therefore also to the truth; but truly, this alone is not enough for
 you to be able to change yourselves effortlessly and spontaneously in your inner nature, in your individuality –
 and that is the actual problem, because it is also necessary for a complete change to take place in your inner
 nature.
140) Many amongst you do not wish to change themselves in their inner nature, and a change of the inner nature is particularly unattractive to those amongst you who are well provided for and secure to a certain extent in
economic and social respects, and therefore who only have minor problems if indeed any at all; but there are
also those amongst you who are captured by and dependent on your religion and who hold fast to your reli- gious, ideological or philosophical imaginations, or who are ready simply to accept all things of the existence and your own self, and to live with them just as they happen to be or happen to impinge upon you in any quite distinct or altered kind and wise whatsoever.
141) However, all this is wrong and it is a life-attitude that does not correspond with the truth and reality, and indeed not with the guidelines of the creational laws and recommendations either, which are not difficult to
recognise and to fulfil, indeed even if they do appear to be too heavy and too power-destroying for you to
recognise and to fulfil, because you are too weak towards yourselves and, what is more too cowardly to sepa-
rate yourselves from the false of your individuality which gives you so much apparent joy and apparent well-
being if you live according to your Ausartungen, your vices and pathological cravings, your hatred, your unfree-
dom, disharmony and the unpeace as well as your pathological craving for revenge and all other terrible things.
142) In all this doing and acting with regard to your Ausartungen, you human beings of Earth are blocked off
 towards the truth, because of which you also do not search for the truth and also cannot fathom it out, there-
 fore it is pointless and nonsensical for you to complain about all the Ausartungen of the society, which are fun-
 damentally given in yourselves and bring forth malicious effects which lead to further misforming of your inner
 nature, as a result of which you sink in yourselves and in the society ever more deeply into a negation of the
 truth and into new Ausartungen time and time again.
143) Truly, many amongst you create illusions for themselves and assume that they must undertake a fundamental
 developmental change in their inner nature, however with the aspect that they need to be helped with bring-
 ing about the developmental change and that they must be shown the way thereto; but truthly, such a way
 cannot be shown, because each process in yourselves for the developmental change of your own inner nature,
 i.e. of the individuality and attitudes, etc., is purely individual or personal and can only be fulfilled by those
 human beings amongst you who work on it themselves.
144) And those of you who search for help in order to be shown a way in the form of a method or a system for
 the developmental change of your own inner nature, those are not really seriously working on an effective
 developmental change, because everything is merely directed towards having others do everything in order to
 bring about the apparently desired developmental change, whereas there is no fundamental interest in a devel-
 opmental change of the inner nature, but only an interest in having others use a method or a system which is
 intended to lead to the apparently wished for developmental change of your own individuality with only minor
 help from yourselves.
145) But truly, each way, each method or each system for the developmental change of the inner nature is purely
 individual, i.e. personal and cannot be transferred to another by you, therefore it would be exceedingly fool-
 ish to name a way, a method or a system; if this however were to be done, then you would only be following
 an imitation, i.e. a pattern, and thereby taking over the purely individual way, i.e. the method or the system of
 another and copying the entire thing into yourselves, through which you would unavoidably get yourselves
 into difficulties and hardships that are based in the thoughts, feelings, consciousness and psyche, namely
 through an adapting to an external individuality and through an approval of the same, which without doubt
 brings forth confusion in your own mental-block and leads to chaos in the psyche and consciousness.
146) This means, if you do such a thing, that you set up the authority of one of your fellow human beings in your-
 selves, through which enormous conflicts are brought forth between yourselves and the external authority, as
 a result of which you believe that you are obliged to do this or that which is told and dictated to you, although
 you are incapable of actually doing it, because you cannot exchange your inner nature with that of one of your
 fellow human beings, but must be yourselves and free in yourselves in every wise, therefore two inner natures
 cannot be existent in you either.
147) You human beings of Earth, you are individual natures who have your own thoughts and feelings and well as
 your own and therefore individual intentions and inclinations, hardships and needs as well as wishes which can
 in no kind and wise be integrated in an external method or an external system which you believe you must
 follow.
148) In all respects, an external authority stands in opposition to your own person and dignity, therefore the recog-
 nition of an external authority in yourselves is a contradiction to your own inner freedom and cannot be toler -
 ated under any circumstances.
149) If you tolerate it nevertheless, then you are no longer yourselves, but rather you lead an existence of doubtful-
 ness and therefore a life between the external method, i.e. the external system, i.e. an external ideology and
 the effective reality of your true life.
150) If you allow to let yourselves in for an attempt in such a wise that brings your own inner nature into conso-
 nance with the external authority, i.e. the external ideology, then you demolish your own self-consciousness
 and suppress your entirely own individuality.
151) The actual truth of your self is not anchored in the external authority, i.e. ideology, but solely and alone in you
 yourselves, and indeed in that which you effectively are.
 152) Therefore, you shall consider that, if you fathom out yourselves, you do not direct yourselves according to
 others, not according to an external authority, i.e. not according to an external ideology, but only according to
 yourselves and according to what you truthfully are and in all honesty want to be and also strive to be; how-
 ever, if you do not follow this guidance then you will remain during the time of your life as human beings who
 live from the authority of others and are subserviently dependent on them in debasing submissiveness.
153) If you wish to change yourselves, human beings of Earth, and if in doing so you demand that you shall be told
 how you shall do this, then it may very well appear upright that you really want to do it, but that does not cor-
 respond to the truth, because truthly you are being unhonest and do not want it, since you are calling for an
 external authority which is supposed to help you to achieve a new inner regulation of your inner nature, there-
 fore you are hoping to attain a new individuality through it and through its method, i.e. its system, but this is
 truly not possible because only you yourselves can change yourselves fundamentally through your own moti-
 vation, initiative and power, therefore you must also go your own way.
154) An external authority is never able to change your inner nature, your individuality and create a new inner regu-
 lation in yourselves, but truly only yourselves; if, however, an external attempt is made nevertheless to impose
 a new regulation of your inner nature, i.e. your individuality, then an enormous chaos will inevitably arise in
 you, through which you are cast into dependency and confusion.
155) This fact, you human beings of Earth, is something to which you must respond with intellect and rationality,
 and recognise it as effective truth, so that you may understand that for your consciousness and for your inner
 nature no other authority than your own comes into consideration.
156) If you read and follow a book or other scripts, if you listen to a teacher, to your friends, parents, brothers and sisters, acquaintances, to the other partner in your partnership – whether man or woman – or to an authority
or to the society, etc. then this is already an outward and external authority by which you will be captured and
made dependent if you do not autonomously think through in yourselves what you have read and heard and
if you cannot in yourselves develop it into a valueful factor of the truth that is independent from the outside;
but if you do not do this then you will continue to live only according to a pattern and a pre-given formula, as
you have done since time immemorial, through enslaving yourselves to an external authority and ideology.
157) But if you really want to change yourselves in your consciousness and in your inner nature, and therefore also
 acquire a new and sound individuality for yourselves thereby, then you must ask yourselves how you can
 change to the good and better and how you can create in yourselves a new authority that is your own, by
 means of which you then put an end for all time to any external as well as your own, old authority, so that
 you are then only yourselves.
158) In order to achieve this, however, you must change yourselves down to the roots of your inner nature and exis-
 tence, as well as in your consciousness which you must direct in its function into the right lines of right
 thoughts, out of which right and good feelings arise accordingly, through which you not only form your own
 psyche but also influence your inner nature towards a new individuality in a good wise.
159) And if you act in this wise, then you will no longer be dependent on any external tradition through which an
 enormous dependency, indolence and subservience is imposed upon you, which has ruled you since time
 immemorial.
160) Therefore, always consider that you can never expect any help whatsoever from outside with regard to your
 inner developmental change, but that you can in every wise only help yourselves; what can be given to you
 from the outside through external authorities is no more and no less than a direction or teaching of what you
 actually have to do, that you simply must change yourselves to the better; however, the way, the method or
 the system is something that you must find in yourselves, because this is a purely individual and therefore per-
 sonal concern, since truly each human being is an individuum of their own which has their own individual
 ways, methods and systems in order to deal with both themselves and with the world around.
161) Therefore there is no god, no tin god, no teacher, no dogma, no method and no system, no coercion, no cleric,
 no false or true prophet and also no other human being or other external influence through which you could
 be shown an individual way to an inner developmental change in your inner nature and consciousness, because
 this individuality is only given in yourselves.
162) If you only want, you can reject any external authority and only accept your own and therefore truly only be
 yourselves, through which it arises that you no longer let yourselves be enmeshed in ideologies, philosophies
 and religions and also that you no longer go in fear of gods, tin gods or demons nor any of your fellow human
 beings, because if you finally recognise your own value, then you will not let yourselves be led any longer either
 through subservience, i.e. through submissiveness or treated as a second-class human being and even bullied,
 but rather you place yourselves in your value on the same level with your fellow human beings, without how -
 ever raising yourselves up over them.
163) And when you are finally yourselves, then it will happen that you repudiate everything false that you as human beings have dragged around with yourselves for many generations, and truly when this happens then an ever
greater energy will grow in you, out of which more and more power will unfold through which you will come
to ever more, greater and more extensive life-capability as well as to greater vital courage which has inherent
in itself very much more intensity, drive and vitality than can be entirely lived out, therefore large reserves are always available which can no longer run out.
164) And once you have achieved this and brought it to ample effect in yourselves, then you have liberated your-
 selves from the heaviest burden of your life and have cast off from yourselves everything connected with exter-
 nal authorities as well as the heavy weight of your own old and unworthy authority which is now replaced
 through a new, powerful and energy-rich one.
165) Truly, the very realisation of a great developmental change to the good and better is already in you if you be-
 come conscious that you have cast off everything that is old, valueless and unsuitable, and through that have
 won very much more energy and power, by means of which there is no longer any fear in you whatsoever of
 committing errors, which you inevitably must commit, since it is only out of these that you can learn.
166) The very fact alone that you no longer have any fear of acting rightly or wrongly creates a lot of energy and
 power in you, and this alone already represents a developmental change in you.
167) Truly, you human beings of Earth, you require a huge amount of energy and power in order to lead your lives, but you waste a very great part of this power and energy through your anxieties and through your fear, how-
ever if you turn to the real truth and through this dissipate your anxieties and fear as well as all the terrible
things in yourselves consciously through intellect and rationality, then you will create new energy and power
through this which independently brings forth a radical inner upheaval and actual developmental change.
168) However, always be conscious that you are left up to yourselves in all these things and endeavours of the inner
 developmental change, because if you are serious about your inner developmental change as well as all the
 things that are connected with it, then truly in this process of the serious inner developmental change the status
 is given that you are actually alone with yourselves as human beings.
169) In the process of your inner developmental change you cannot expect help from any god or tin god or from
 any human being or from anything else, because apart from yourselves there is nothing that could carry out
 your inner change.
170) If, however, you consciously carry out your inner developmental change through your energy and power, then
 you will no longer expect help from outside, from anyone, from any god, tin god, angel, saint or demon or
 from the deceased, because in the conscious developmental change that you bring about in yourselves you are
 already free in yourselves and are able to see what your developmental change brings you in terms of that
 which is good, better and positive.
171) And consider, when you are free in yourselves that there is also great energy and power in you besides the fact that nothing else can be done wrong with regard to the developmental change of the inner nature; and once
there is freedom in you then this has nothing to do with a defence, but rather with you being able to act rightly
and freely henceforth according to your own discretion, precisely because you are free in yourselves and act
out of the centre of your changed inner nature; and therefore you no longer have any anxiety and fear, but are
henceforth capable of creating true love in yourselves and also living it out in yourselves to your fellow human
beings, because when you have true love in you then you can do in the right and the good what you want.
172) And if you have created true love in yourselves, then out of this the process arises that you get to know your-
 selves and that you go in self-cognition in yourselves, which however in turn only happens through yourselves,
 but not through psychologists or psychiatrists and not either through any other analysts, through philosophers
 or those who arrogantly assume that they can be of assistance to you in the self-cognition, although they are
 not capable of this; therefore you truthly do not learn anything through them and you cannot learn anything
 about your self, but basically only about the one who wants to be helpful to you in the self-cognition.
173) Truly, what your fellow human beings such as psychologists and philosophers, etc. can teach you is not what
 you are in yourselves, in your inner nature, i.e. in your individuality, rather they can only teach you your charac-
 teristics, your peculiarities that proceed out of your inner nature, but not however the individuality, the special -
 ness and uniqueness which go very far beyond the characteristics and are connected to the innermost part of
 the inner nature, which is of pure spiritual nature and belongs to the realm of the spirit-form in which the true
 love and the life are guided from out of the creational laws and recommendations.
174) Therefore, self-cognition is not the same as self-cognition, and individuality is not the same as individuality,
 because truthly both things must be separated in themselves, indeed on the one side in the material realm
 which is outwardly expressed in you human beings and that realm which only acts in the inner, so therefore it
 is necessary to speak of a material and outwardly directed self-cognition and individuality, and on the other
 side of an inner one which really only acts through the power of the spirit-form in the inner of the nature and
 must be laboriously fathomed out in order to let it have an effect in the exterior, material self-cognition and
 individuality, fragment by fragment, gradually over the course of the life, as a result of which your being human
 in the real and true sense evolves over time.
175) It is only through inner self-cognition, which must be fathomed in the core of your inner nature, that you expe- rience and learn what you actually are in the inner of your own self, which is connected with the spirit-realm,
whereas that which is around the core corresponds to that part of the inner nature which is lived as individua-
lity towards the outside and reflects the material character and the personality, out of which the behaviour and the actions and effort are also determined.
176) In the entire process, you must also look at and consider and bring forth a revolution of the consciousness, its
 thoughts as well as their feelings and the thereout resulting psyche-structure which may no longer be depen-
 dent on an external authority; however, this process involves great difficulties because what is important in the
 revolutionising of the consciousness, thoughts, feelings and the psyche, i.e. the entire mental-block is repudi-
 ating your own inner and demolished authority in which are anchored all your unimportant perceptions, cogni-
 tions, cognisances, your pseudo-knowledge, your practical experiences and the living of those experiences as
 well as all your views, ideas and ideals; truly, during your lifetime, you had things, happenings and experiences
 that have taught you something, but you have raised up all that which you have learned to a new authority
 in you by which you are ruled and which has just as great a destructive effect in you as an authority which is
 already thousands of years old.
177) Truly, if you want to understand yourselves, both in your innermost, spiritual individuality and in your outward,
 material individuality, then you require neither the authority that you have built up in yourselves during your
 lifetime nor that which is thousands of years old, because you are something vital which is in continuous move-
 ment and knows no rest; therefore you must not look at yourselves and attempt to fathom yourselves with the
 dead authority of your up-till-now life, rather you must look at yourselves with the newly created authority,
 because only through this is it possible for you really to understand everything that lies in the movement and
 the beauty of the whole.
178) You human beings of Earth, you must be free from any external authority and create your own free and good
 authority in yourselves, therefore you must also be free from your own old and inadequate authority which
 you have confusingly and erroneously built up in yourselves during your life; you have to make yourselves free
 and loosen yourselves from everything that was in your past with regard to your false individuality, because
 only in this wise do you manage that your mental-block, your consciousness, your thoughts and feelings as
 well as your psyche are full of energy and power at all times, are in youthfulness and nevertheless shining in
 wisdom as well as innocent and full of interest; truly, it is only in this status that you can be really attentive and
 heedful and you can really perceive, observe and recognise everything, and learn thereout.
179) Consider that you human beings of Earth primarily require a conscious and comprehensive consciousness so
 that you are capable of directly being aware of your inner and innermost life-process and can direct it in such
 a wise that you do not need to correct it continuously, so that you make progress and the whole is what it shall
 be, but not what it shall not be.
180) If you constantly have to correct your life-process, then you are imposing a censor which is nothing other than
 again a new authority which once again dictates new things to you which you follow and through which you
 are again and again wrongly guided.
181) If you really want to learn then you must start a long journey in yourselves through your entire nature, through
 its shell and inner and through its core, and also through your entire mental-block and consciousness-block, in
 which case the consciousness, thoughts and feelings are of just as much importance as are the character and
 personality; and for this journey you must be unweighted, without opinions and prejudices, as well as unbur-
 dened through thoughts and feelings and all the rubbish which has built up in you since time immemorial and
 has burdened you; forget everything that you yourselves have assumed and thought to know about yourselves,
 and attempt to recognise yourselves in the wise as if you had never seen yourselves before and never heard
 anything about yourselves previously, so that you approach yourselves in a totally neutral wise and fathom out
 what and who you truthly are.
