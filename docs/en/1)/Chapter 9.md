# Chapter 9
1) Make a declaration of a solemn release from any attachment (obligation) towards gods and tin gods and their
 servants of gods and servants of tin gods to whom you have made promises and in whom you believe.
2) Free yourselves from all beliefs (assumptions) of your godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults)
 and learn the knowledge about the truth of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Cre-
 ation), so that you become knowing ones of the truth, following the true laws and recommendations of the
 life, so that you do not ruin anything that has been given to you through the appearance (nature) and through
 anything else of the fertilisation of the life (Creation); do not continue to spend your existence (life) in submis-
 siveness and servitude (bondage) to gods and tin gods and to servants of gods and servants of tin gods, be-
 cause submission casts you down into an abasement of yourselves, into subservience and denial of yourselves
 (self-denial), so that you are unfree and chained and cannot live according to your own determination (will)
 because you are bound by amenableness (obedience/servility).
3) Be unattached (free) from all gods, tin gods, servants of gods and servants of tin gods, regret your belief (as-
 sumptions) in them and turn yourselves away from them so that you become strong and can no longer ruin
 anything that is given to you in the extent (entirety) through the fertilisation of the life (Creation), such as true
 love and freedom, peace and consonance (harmony) in yourselves; make yourselves unattached (free) from
 gods, tin gods, servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because it is through their belief (assumptions) which
 they have forced on you that they cause you pain in your thoughts and feelings, so in them you fall prey to
 uncertainty as well as anguish and fear, wherein you persist because they threaten you with punishment and
 judgement of the gods and tin gods.
4) Also, do not make any exception for those servants of gods and servants of tin gods as well as those godli-
 nesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) with whom you have entered into an agreement (credo), be-
 cause they are in their entirety connected to the lie against the truth and they slander (calumniate) the fertili-
 sation of the life (Creation) by praying and supplicating to gods and tin gods which are however nothing more
 than hazy pictures (fantasies) of people of your kind (human beings) who have fallen into confusion in their
 inner world (consciousness); do not heed the agreement (credo) entered into, because it is without value and
 is based on confused directives (regulations) of godly (religious) belief-oriented zealots (fanatics).
5) But consider that even the servants of gods and servants of tin gods are people of your kind (human beings)
 and therefore also they are not safe (protected) from erroneous assumption and confusion, therefore they pray
 to gods and tin gods and spend their existence (life) in belief (assumptions) in them; and because they are also
 people of your kind (human beings), treat them as such and do not persecute, seize or kill (murder) them, rather
 be kindhearted to them and instruct (teach) them the truth wherever you meet them; therefore do not wait in
 ambush for them and do not establish any ambuscade against them, rather instruct (teach) them rightfully and
 in love so that they may recognise (see) their unknowledgeness of the truth and repent, so they turn to the
 real truth of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, and become free for the
 way to the truthly truth.
6) And if a servant of gods or servant of tin gods searches for protection amongst you, then grant him or her
 commensurate protection and, if he or she is willing, instruct (teach) him or her in the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life; and grant him or her protection and provision (nourishment)
 until he or she can once again safely continue on his or her way and reach the places of his or her safety (home-
 stead, etc.) without danger.
7) And consider, there can never be an agreement (arrangement) between yourselves and the gods and tin gods, because they are only hazy pictures (fantasies) and without power, without knowledge, without love and with-
out wisdom, and therefore, for the same reasons, there can also be no agreement (arrangement) between
gods, tin gods and servants of gods and servants of tin gods, and thus if the servants of gods and servants of
tin gods nevertheless claim that they have an agreement (arrangement) then they are shameful (disgraceful) liars and knowing (conscious) manipulators (cheaters), miserable ones (rascals) and Hanaken (riff-raff).
8) And even if the servants of gods and servants of tin gods prevail over you through agreements (credos), then
 there is nevertheless no bond (connection) between them and you, neither any blood relationship, nor do they
 heed any agreement made with you (any connection of belief), because they believe themselves to be superior
 to you; truly, they think they are more than you, and therefore they only say pleasing things to you with their
 mouths, whereas their attitude (mentality) refuses to set themselves equal with you, because truly most of
 them are full of malice.
9) The servants of gods and servants of tin gods sell you for a miserable price in order to multiple their riches
 through you and to lead you into the erroneous assumption of belief (assumptions), false signs (evidence/testi-
 monies/avowals/confessions) of the godly (religious) belief (assumptions) and of the fabulated (invented) gods
 and tin gods, so that you turn away from the way of the truth, and so they can repugnantly enslave you (make
 you in thrall to them)..
10) Truly, they do not heed any bond (connection of belief) with you and therefore they do not keep (maintain)
 any faithfulness in a bond because they only heed their own false belief (assumptions) and are true misdoers
 against you because they lead you into evil erroneous assumption through false teachings.
11) They practise their submissive service to gods and tin gods and lie that they are your brothers and sisters, and
 they give you false signs (evidence/testimonies/avowals/confessions) of their belief (assumptions) so that you
 assume (believe) that they are signs (evidence) of the truth, whilst everything is mere lies, slanders (calumnies)
 and cheating.
12) And if you ask them about their agreement (credo) and about their oath and you approach their belief (assump-
 tions) in an objective (neutral) wise, then they assume themselves attacked (accused) and fight (battle) against
 you as self-appointed leaders and representation of their belief (assumption) and of their gods and tin gods
 and accuse (blame) you of unbelief, because truly, they have no respect (venerability) towards you, because
 you do not stray from the truth.
13) And many amongst them violate the rights and offend against the laws and recommendations of the primal
 power (Creation), because they secretly commit an offence in libidity (sexually) on children and on man and
 woman; and it is the servants of gods and servants of tin gods who are in dispute against the truliness of the
 teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and want to drive those away from it
 who live in constancy (unity/coalescence) with it; but do not be afraid of them because they do not have any
 might over you if you do not give it to them, because consider that if you are ones who are knowing of the
 truth then you stand above all fear with your dignity.
14) However, do not fight against the servants of gods and servants of tin gods through strife or through punish-
 ment from your own hand, rather let them be lost in their belief (assumptions) in their submissiveness to their
 gods and tin gods, because they must find the truth themselves; and it is only when they turn to the truth and
 they achieve victory over their false belief that you can teach them and help them onto the way of the truth,
 so that they may bring themselves healing (cognition) from their unknowledge of the truth, and become ones
 who are knowing of the truth.
15) If rage rises up in you against the servants of gods and servants of tin gods, then banish (drive out) the rage
 in you and choose forgiveness in yourselves so that you do rightfully and are attached to (follow) the laws and
 recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation).
16) Never assume that you have been abandoned by the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Cre-
 ation) because you do not recognise them or do not understand them, because if you turn yourselves to them
 and do not conduct strife against them (do not set yourselves against them), then they will become trusted
 friends to you if you become knowing (conscious) of them and you know what you are doing.
17) The servants of gods and servants of tin gods are however unable to recognise (see) the laws and recommen-
 dations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) in their submissiveness, because they testify against it (Creation)
 through their belief (assumptions) in their gods and tin gods; and truly the deeds of the servants of gods and
 servants of tin gods are in vain, so they burn in the fire of their false belief (assumptions) and cannot liberate
 themselves from it.
18) Those amongst you who are connected to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life, you shall be an ideal to all in following and fulfilling the laws and recommendations of the primal
 power (Creation) so that you are a sign (evidence) to the ones who are unknowing of the truth that they do
 not have to be afraid of the truth if they find the right way.
19) As people of your kind (human beings), you are all the same, you have the same rights and conscientiousnesses (duties), therefore the one is no more than another; and all people of your kind (human beings) are integrated
into the unfolding (evolution) of your inner world (consciousness), so you are also integrated into fallibilities
(errors) that you commit and learn from them in order to give enough consideration to the unfolding (evolution).
20) Do not assume that you can spread the truth-teaching of the true laws and recommendations of the fertilisa - tion of the life (Creation), as is presented through the true prophets, by means of battles (wars) or in any other
wise through Gewalt (terror) and coercion, because truly you only take the highest level in this and make a gain (success) if you fulfil your deeds of teaching in accordance with the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and so you act out of love alone and heed freedom and peace as well as consonance (harmony).
21) Spread the joyful message of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life in a
 peaceful wise amongst all those who open their ears to it and want to learn; never attempt to draw attention
 to the truth-teaching with Gewalt (terror), just as you shall also not represent the teaching with the sword or
 with other weapons of the dangerousness and killing, but rather only in true love and equitableness (fairness),
 in peace and freedom, so that a consonance (harmony) is given and that delight and permanent happiness
 may arise.
22) The teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life shall never be passed on (spread) outrageously (using Gewalt), nor through lying and nor through slander (calumny), because as a teaching from
the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), it is a teaching of the love, peace, freedom and
consonance (harmony) from which neither outrage (act of Gewalt), bloody deed (murder), persecution, battle
(war) nor strife can be allowed to emanate, but only permanent well-protectedness and all values of goodness.
23) Truly, living in well-protectedness in the love of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) is the highest good that
 can accrue to people of your kind (human beings) and in which you can dwell (live) forever as a magnificent
 reward if you are only fruitful (bearing) of your true discernment (rationality) and you recognise and follow the
 laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) through your insight (intellect).
24) If you are undisguised (sincere) and strong in the knowledge about the truth, then it is also possible for you to
 keep your sisters, brothers and your father and your mother without blemish (without virtuelessness) in honour
 and dignity, even if they prefer a belief (assumptions) in gods or tin gods to the teaching of the truth, the teach-
 ing of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because they are the ones who are unknowing of the truth; therefore
 you are not unfair ones (irresponsible ones) if you have them as friends and love and honour and appreciate
 them, because they belong to your blood; therefore you are not unfair ones (irresponsible ones) either if you
 have acquaintances and friends, man and woman, and they prefer a belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods,
 but you are however undisguised (sincere) and strong in the knowledge about the truth, so that you do not
 become inconstant in it.
25) And if your father and your mother, your brothers, your sisters, your wife or husband or your clan (relations)
 or people of your kind (fellow human beings) have fallen prey to gods and tin gods, then you shall not make
 them your enemies because of this, rather esteem (honour and value) them highly because, regardless of how
 you look at it, they are people of your kind (human beings) who are due (entitled to) honour and dignity which
 you shall show them; and if they prize their riches and their commerce and their dwellings more highly (more
 valuefully) than the truth about the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and the recognition and fulfilment of the
 laws and recommendations of itself and its appearance (nature), then love and honour and appreciate them
 nevertheless as people of your kind (human beings), because they have proceeded from the primal (creative)
 unchangeabilities (principles) as you have, so you are one and the same kind, without difference, with the same
 rights and obligations (duties) with regard to the fulfilment of your existence (life) and the unfolding (evolu -
 tion) of your inner world (consciousness).
26) Truly, if you wage battles (wars), then there is no god and no tin gods who lead you on the battlefield (field of
 war) because they are only hazy pictures (fantasies) of godly (religious) zealots (fanatics) who want to make
 you proud of them; everything godly (religious observances) is useless because fabulated (invented) forms such
 as godheads and tin gods possess neither power nor ability to effect anything; therefore, if you wage battles
 (wars) then they can neither help you to victory nor to flight.
27) Truly, it is decided (determined) through the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation)
 that peace and love, as well as freedom and consonance (harmony) shall rule amongst people of your kind
 (human beings), therefore you shall follow them in order to receive a good reward.
28) Therefore it is also recommended to you that you also turn to those people of your kind (fellow human beings)
 in goodwill (respect), who are unknowing in the truth and need your instruction and help.
29) Consider however that the servants of gods and servants of tin gods who are unclean (without knowledge) in the knowledge of the truth, do everything to keep their believers in their gods and tin gods away from the
truthly truth of the reality of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and the laws and recommendations of itself
and of its appearance (nature); therefore they attempt to ensure that those who are looking for the real truth
of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) cannot approach the truth, by besetting their believers with apprehensions
(anxieties and fear) of punishment from their gods and tin gods if they leave the belief (assumptions) in them,
whilst promising them at the same time a liberation from punishment as well as a fullness (abundance) of love,
blissful happiness as well as richness in consciousness and wellbeing if they stay with their belief (assumptions).
30) Fight in yourselves against the enticements of the servants of gods and servants of tin gods and against all those who have the audacity to slander (calumniate) and call into question the truth of the fertilisation of the
life and the laws and recommendations of itself and of its appearance (nature); and be certain (knowing) that
their actions are illicit (forbidden) and heinous (villainous) for the sake of right and equitableness (fairness), because by doing so they lead people of your kind (human beings) into shameful erroneous assumption far from any cognition of the truthly truth of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation); they do not follow the real truth, and they will only do so when they have to pay tribute from their own inner world (consciousness) for the acknowledging of the real truth when they become knowing (con- scious) of it.
31) What the servants of gods and servants of tin gods are speaking about and fallaciously teaching is not the
 word of the truth, but only the word from their mouth which they think up through their thoughts and their
 inner world (consciousness); and therefore they only imitate the speeches of those who were already ones
 unknowing of the truth before them and who were of the same kind in their zealotry (fanaticism) which
 weighs banefully on them because they are misled.
32) The servants of gods and servants of tin gods have taken the old scribes and false prophets as their masters
 (examples) who extensively falsified the real truth of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and its laws and
 recommendations and made it unrecognisable; and they also lied that the truthly prophets were gods and chil-
 dren of gods or their representatives (substitutes) or heralds of evil (devils); and like the old servants of gods
 and servants of tin gods, the old scribes and false prophets demanded, your servants of gods and servants of
 tin gods and those versed in godly (religious) writings also demand (command) that you must join their belief
 (assumptions) and pray to their gods and tin gods or to the evil (devil) and supposedly venerable ones (holy
 ones) and that you shall not place the real truth of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) nor its laws and recom-
 mendations next to these.
33) The servants of gods and servants of tin gods would very much like the light of the truth of the fertilisation of
 the life (Creation) to be extinguished by the words coming from their mouth, but they are unable to do this
 over time because the light of the truth is perfect and will light up the world in its time, even though those
 unknowing of the truth and the servants of gods and servants of tin gods may dislike it.
34) And the real truth is that given to the true prophets so that they may guide the leadership of the truthly teach- ing of the truth and bring their cognition of the truth to you in order that it may prevail in you and liberate
you from all the false avowals in gods and tin gods, in servants of gods and servants of tin gods and in godli-
nesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults); be knowing (conscious) that many of the servants of gods
and servants of tin gods and their godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) seize your goods and
your riches and consume them through false means of belief (assumptions), and so they attempt to lead (turn)
you away from the way of the truth with regard to the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and of its laws and
recommendations; and truly many amongst them heap up gold and silver by enriching themselves from you.
35) And they clothe themselves in expensive garments and have valueful coverings (hats) on their head, decorated
 with gold and silver and precious stones, and also they wear much valueful jewellery which they gain from your
 riches by exploiting you; and through their garments and their covering (hats) and through their jewellery they
 accuse (blame) you for your foolishness for giving them, as a result of your belief in gods and belief in tin gods,
 the things which you laboriously heap up (save) for yourselves to live on in old age.
36) Just as the servants of gods and servants of tin gods altogether exploit you with lies and slanders (calumnies)
 and fight (battle) against you so that you cannot find the truth of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) or its
 laws and recommendations, so you shall also fight (battle) against them in a good wise so that you do not
 open your ears to their lies and slanders (calumnies) of the truth, so that you do not present them with your
 riches and do not nourish them at your breast (do not pay for their welfare).
37) Truly, putting off learning the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life promotes
 a multiplication of the truth-unknowledge, because the ones who have no knowledge will be deluded even
 more through this by the untruth of the teachings of the false prophets and of the servants of gods and ser-
 vants of tin gods who ban you the truth-teaching and do not allow you to learn from it; truly they only want
 to allow you to learn things of writings and teachings that correspond to their godlinesses (religions) and sub-
 godlinesses (sects/cults) and with their dogmas and submissiveness (belief), because they are zealots (fanatical
 believers) who make the goodness and the truth of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and of its laws and
 recommendations appear evil (devilish) and make the real evil appear pleasing to you.
38) Do not be believers in gods and tin gods and in their servants (hands/helpers), for whom you are supposed to cast yourselves down onto the earth and worship and honour them, when they say to you that you shall walk
on the way of the gods and tin gods; truly, you shall turn to the truthly life here below on Earth and be con-
tent with it; however, you shall not pray to gods and tin gods or to people of your kind (human beings) who
raise themselves up as gods, their envoys or representatives (substitutes); and truly, the enjoyment of earthly
life is not small, but very great and full of happiness and joy, full of peace and love, freedom and consonance
(harmony) if you follow the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation),
 the teaching that is given through the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the
 life.
39) And the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) not only demand (recommend) to main-
 tain peace, love and freedom and consonance (harmony) amongst all people of your kind (humankind) and to
 take care not to go out to fight or wage battles (wars), but they also demand (recommend) that you do not
 practise outrageous (inhumane) punishment on people of your kind (human beings) and that you shall not
 harm the body and life of people of your kind (fellow human beings), either their inner world (consciousness)
 or the psyche; truly, you have might over all things, but be fair and use your might rightfully as well.
40) Help people of your kind (the next ones), and help the other people of your kind (fellow human beings), just
 as you shall also help all people of your kind (humankind) so that everyone may escape from unknowledge,
 hardship and misery and are not forced to remain therein; and teach them that they must not be sorrowful for
 their unknowledge, their hardship and their misery if they turn to the truth which contains love and knowl-
 edge as well as peace, freedom and consonance (harmony) in itself, by means of which every person of your
 kind (human being) can elevate himself or herself to the highest heights and no longer debase themselves
 through the word of the slanderers (calumniators) against the truth and the laws and recommendations of the
 fertilisation of the life (Creation).
41) But do not go forth, lightly or heavily (in lightness or onerosity), and do not struggle with your goods and riches
 or with your blood for the sake of the truth, because love, peace, freedom, consonance (harmony) as well as
 joy and happiness cannot be purchased with goods or riches, or paid for with blood.
42) And do not take any reward or any other gain if you teach the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
 the teaching of the life with your own mouth amongst people of your kind (fellow human beings), so that you
 are not as the servants of gods and servants of tin gods who pronounce with their mouth their false teachings
 of the false prophets for a high reward and blind (delude) you before alters, and who also rebuke people of
 your kind (human beings) from high places (pulpits) in hypocrisy; never take any compensation (payment) if
 you proclaim the truth-teaching out of your mouth, because the truth is not yours, but rather belongs to the
 fertilisation of the life (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, therefore you shall not conduct commerce
 with it through your mouth, because it is unrightful to trade (sell) the truth-teaching or advice from it through
 the mouth in return for compensation (payment); however, it is indeed rightful for you to take signs of grati-
 tude (gifts) for your teaching and advice from your mouth if you do not demand (ask for) the same, but rather
 if it is given to you out of voluntariness and kindheartedness; and it is rightful for you to take compensation
 (payment) for the journey if you go out and travel in order to explain the truth-teaching through your mouth
 at a desired location; and also it is rightful for you to take in exchange (purchase price/remuneration) if you
 produce writings and sources (books) with the truth-teaching and you release (sell) them.
43) If you follow the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), then your worries will
 be taken away from you, and truly you will not lag behind in your unfolding (evolution), because when you
 know the real truth and follow it, things will be fine with you; and truly, if you recognise the truth and follow
 it, then you will recognise those amongst you who want to do you harm and who are liars and slanderers
 (calumniators) against the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, so you will
 be able to guard yourselves against (watch out for) them and not allow them to make you turn away from the
 truth.
44) You who know about the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and about
 the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and who follow the laws and recommendations, you do not have to apply
 in yourselves especially for permission to be liberated from strife and not to fight with goods and blood for the
 truth, because through the following of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power
 (Creation), you are already liberated from all strife, as well as from fighting for the truth with your goods and
 your blood.
45) And you who know about the truth of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation),
 do not let yourselves be asked by those who are unknowing of the truth to stand by them and instruct (teach)
 them with your knowledge about the truth and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teach -
 ing of the life, rather be open (honest) with them, without conceit (imperiousness) and always ready to give
 (pass on) your knowledge without having to be asked to do so; do not leave people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) in doubt that you will always be helpful to them in finding the truth if they are striving to turn to the
 truth; and you shall not be vacillating in doubt regarding whether to help each person of your kind (next one)
 in finding the truth if he or she is striving for it and searching for enlightenment (clarification) from you.
46) And if you are not equipped with good knowledge in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, then do not decide to go out in order to spread the truth-teaching, rather be averse to
such because without sufficient knowledge you can do more harm than good (success), therefore you shall stay back (remain at home) with the other sedentary ones (ones remaining at home) if you are not sufficiently skilful (well-versed/well-read) in the teaching.
47) If you go out to spread the truth and you are not sufficiently skilful (well-versed/well-read), then you will increase
 the worries of those who are to be taught, and also your own worries, because it is through your insufficient
 knowledge in the truth that you will run backwards and forwards without finding any stability, which gives rise
 to discord between you and the ones to be taught because some will listen to you and some will be against
 you if you cannot explain the things of the truth to a sufficient extent (insufficiently), therefore leading to doubt
 and misunderstandings as well as outrage (acts of Gewalt).
48) And consider that many truth-unknowers and many unfair ones (irresponsible ones) are only concerned with
 striving for chaos and forging intrigues (guilefulnesses) against you, therefore they maliciously slander (calum-
 niate) you if you are not steadfast in the truth-teaching; so you shall wait with the delivering (spreading) of the
 truth-teaching until the truth prevails (thrives) in you to such an extent that you are able to teach it rightfully,
 so that the unfair (irresponsible) conflict-seekers (troublemakers) who are unknowing of the truth cannot be
 averse to your explanation of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
49) Truly, many amongst those who are searching for the truth search for permission to stay back in the learning
 (just reflect) so that they are not put to the trial (proof), but truly, everyone is constantly put to the trial (proof)
 and cannot stay back (cannot continue reflecting), because the unfolding (evolution) continues without
 interruption and cannot be stopped, therefore everyone is befallen by it at any moment, even if many are
 unknowing and unfair in their inner nature and therefore create an inner shadow world (hell) in which they
 enclose themselves.
50) And there are many amongst those unknowing of the truth and unfair ones (irresponsible ones) who are mock-
 ing (gloating) if a calamity befalls you, and are saddened if goodness and wellbeing comes to you, but do not
 heed their evil impulsations, because they are unknowing and unfair and do not know what they do, and truly
 you can only show them compassion since they are going into confusion; do not however turn yourselves away
 from them, rather show them goodness and love and attempt to instruct them in the right attitude (behaviour)
 of their thoughts and feelings as well as in their assessment of things, so that they turn away from their wrong
 doing and enjoy right and fairness (responsibility).
51) And truly, nothing can befall you as your own foreordination (destiny) other than what you determine for your-
 selves, because just as you are your own protectors, so you are your own determiner (initiator) over yourselves
 and your doing, so you shall always trust yourselves and decide (determine) everything yourselves as is best, so
 that it may go well and favourably with you.
52) If you are expecting good things for yourselves, then direct your thoughts and feelings and your deeds in a
 good wise towards these things, because it is only thereby that you will come to what you wish and hope for
 yourselves, because all power always lies only by yourselves; however, if you act against this approach, then
 punishment will befall you through your own blame, because what you wish and hope for yourselves is not
 fulfilled.
53) And if you give (donate) to the poor and needy willingly or unwillingly simply for the sake of semblance
 (hypocrisy/sanctimoniousness), then you are making yourselves guilty of deceit, falseness (deviousness) and
 lying, therefore you shall only give donations in honesty and truthly kindheartedness, in order that you may re-
 ceive honour and dignity for this in honesty.
54) Do not prevent yourselves from honestly giving alms (gifts) to the poor and needy or to any other good cause,
 because if you are righteous ones (responsible) then you do not allow yourselves to fall into passivity when you
 see poverty and need which you can relieve through gifts (alms and donations).
55) And truly, those amongst you who reproach those who are giving alms (gifts) in honesty, you would probably
 only be satisfied if you were to receive the alms (gifts) yourselves, but as you receive nothing of them then you
 are angry and reproach the righteous ones (conscientious ones) and fair ones (responsible ones).
56) Alms are only for the poor and needy, so those who are the entrusted ones (distributors) charged with the dis- tribution of alms shall not make use (be beneficiaries) of the same, because truly sharing in the benefit of the
alms by the entrusted ones (distributors) would be deception and thievery (theft) against the givers of alms and
against the poor and needy; collectors of alms, as well as the entrusted ones (distributors) who hand over (give
away/distribute) the collected alms in fair (commensurate) measure amongst the poor and needy shall not be
entitled to take (siphon off) a cut (percentage) of the collected alms for themselves, because alms are a help
in hardship which are expressly intended for the poor and needy and from which the entrusted ones (distribu-
tors) are not allowed to reward or enrich themselves; and if people of your kind (human beings) fall into hard-
ship and misery through all kinds of inequity, cataclysm and destruction (catastrophes), whether it be through
the appearance (nature) or through the hands of people of your kind (human beings), and if goods and gold and silver (money) are collected in order to help the desperate ones (those affected), whether the collection is undertaken by individuals amongst you or by several in a federation (group/society/organisation), then it is also not rightful for the collectors or the entrusted ones (distributors) to gain benefit (success) from what has been collected by channelling smaller or larger parts (percentages) off for themselves for their efforts (exertions) in order thereby to reward themselves and to reimburse themselves for their burden (expenses), because truly acting in this wise is full of shame, without dignity, full of deception and thievery (theft) and contrary to the sense of providing help to those who need it; truly, it is a primal law of the Creation that people of your kind (human beings) shall always be helpful to people of your kind (human beings) without demanding any reward (remuneration/compensation) for this in any wise, because this effect proceeds equally from the laws and recommendations of the appearance (nature), based on the presence (existence) of the fertilisation of the life (Creation).
57) Do not be amazed about the stinginess of many who have great riches, because they always demand more
 and more and greater riches, and at the same time they cannot rein in (moderate) their demand because they
 do not know any bounds (limits) in their greed for more and more riches; therefore do not be amazed about
 your children if they do the same as you, if you have yourselves fallen prey to stinginess, greed and riches.
58) Do not make yourselves guilty of thievery (theft) and do not swear on the truth that things truthfully belong
 to you which you have unrightfully appropriated, because truly they are the property of others from whom you
 have stolen them, therefore you are in the unright and will always live in fear of punishment, just as you will
 also be accused of thievery (theft) and you must give back the stolen goods.
59) And if you are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and breakers of the law (lawbreakers), then you will find no
 refuge amongst the fair ones (responsible ones) and the righteous ones (conscientious ones) of people of your
 kind (fellow human beings), except with those who are also unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and breakers of
 the law (lawbreakers); and truly, if you make yourselves guilty of breaking the laws (lawbreaking) then you will
 only find refuge in caves or in a bolthole if you flee there in great haste in order to escape giving account for
 your actions; but truly, equitableness (fairness) will catch up with you sooner or later even in caves and bolt-
 holes, so as breakers of the laws (lawbreakers) you will not be safe from punishment in any place.
60) Be at all times satisfied with what your life gives you and what you receive from it, what you create (work for)
 yourselves in assiduousness, because truly, your sufficiency (contentment) shall not be an endless fullness (un-
 restricted amassing), rather a measure of modesty.
61) Truly, amongst you there are many who are hostile to (make barbed remarks against) the truth and who offend
 the true prophets, slandering (calumniating) them, forging intrigues against them and attempting to kill them;
 and you cannot accept (tolerate) that they open their ears to all and lend their attention to all in order to advise
 them in goodness, whilst you, acting as seducers, are striving to make all into believers in your gods, tin gods
 and demons, and to drive them into the clutches of the servants of gods and servants of tin gods.
62) And you who are seducers, you are conspirators against the truth, and you swear by your gods and tin gods
 in order to please people of your kind (fellow human beings) and to seduce them, so that they may appreciate
 your gods and tin gods and pray to them and be pleasing to you if they become believers in you.
63) But truly, those of you who defy the truth and the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation), you are living in yourselves in a shadow world (hell) full of flaming (blazing) fire which burns you
up from the inside in hatred, submissiveness, inequity (unfairness), in lovelessness and unrighteousness (con-
sciencelessness), so you will find neither rest nor peace, nor love, nor freedom and no consonance (harmony).
64) Truly, you are hypocrites to yourselves, and you are permanently afraid that the truth might be revealed in you,
 showing you what attitude (mentality) you are the child of, in other words what you are in your inner nature;
 go ahead, mock now, because truly, the truth will also bring your inner nature into the light, which you are
 afraid of.
65) And when the time comes that the truth becomes obvious (recognisable) to you, then you prove yourselves to
 be liars, because you recognise that you have not just chatted and japed foolishly against the truth, but have
 mocked and slandered (calumniated) it, as you do equivalently with the true prophets and their signs (evidence)
 of the truth.
66) And it will not help you in any wise if you apologise to the true prophets for your wrong doing, because you
– even if they forgive you – must excuse yourselves to yourselves in order to find forgiveness in yourselves, because truly it is only if you can forgive yourselves in respect (venerability) before the truth and righteousness (conscientiousness) to which you turn that you will find truthly forgiveness, because you can only liberate your- selves from your blame, if you truly live in the following of the truth.
67) Consider, however, that it is difficult for you and it requires your entire effort and attention if you are searching to liberate yourselves from your blame, because as you are hypocrites so you constantly search for the protec-
tion of people of your kind (hypocrites) whom you close ranks with and demand (endorse) unright and forbid what is right, so you go along in unright; therefore it is recommended to you that you leave (withdraw from) the circle of the hypocrites in its entirety (entirely) and search for the way to the truth so that you truthly turn yourselves to goodness and find in yourselves and outside of yourselves love and freedom, peace and conso- nance (harmony) and so it goes well with you in everything.
68) If you are hypocrites then you live in a shadow world (hell) in yourselves, the flaming (blazing) fire of which
 burns you up from the inside, so you curse yourselves and you punish yourselves constantly because you do
 not find in yourselves and outside of yourselves any true love, any freedom or any consonance (harmony) and
 no peace, just as it was with all those who came before you and were malefactors against (ones who neglected
 their duty to) the truth of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation).
69) Truly, even if you are mighty in power (influence) amongst people of your kind (human beings) as unfair ones
 (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), and if you have many goods and riches and
 children, you will enjoy your fate for only a brief time, because you constantly hunt after new goods and riches,
 and your children take ways that do not please you and bring you grief and worries, because you spoil them
 with your goods and your riches and no longer let them be granted any good guidance (education); and as
 unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), you take delight in idle (feeble)
 speeches, although your works yield nothing, therefore you are lost ones in everything that you do.
70) You unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) have not been reached by the
 tidings, like those who came before you and did the same (equivalent) as you do; and as the true prophets
 came to them and brought them the message of the truth, so you will also have the real truth pointed out
 (instructed) to you by the true prophets, so that you shall not do anything that is unright.
71) Truly, you, man and woman and child, you shall be a true friend to the other, and therefore you shall demand
 (encourage) yourselves to do the right thing and to ban what is unright, so that you all undertake what is right-
 ful and show pity to yourselves in such a wise that you eschew everything that is evil and unfair (irresponsible)
 and unrighteous (conscienceless).
72) If you as man, woman and child, prove yourselves to be ones who are knowing of the truth, fair ones (respon-
 sible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones), then there will be gardens of love and freedom in you, in
 which streams of peace and of consonance (harmony) and the highest happiness flow, in which you will find
 pleasure.
73) And if you, man, woman and child, are connected to the teaching of the prophets, then you are no hypocrites,
 and therefore you are not at strife against the prophets and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
 the teaching of the life, as you others amongst you, who are unfair ones (irresponsible ones), do in a loveless
 wise because you live in a shadow world (hell) and you have created yourselves a disparaging (dishonourable)
 destiny (decision) for acting in unright.
74) Truly, you unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), you lie to and slander
 (calumniate) people of your kind (fellow human beings), and you do evil things, conduct indubitably slander-
 ous speeches, do not bother about the truth and then you swear that you have not said anything; truly, you
 have not accepted the truth and are only brooding on what you cannot achieve in an honest wise, and there-
 fore you nourish yourselves with hatred against people of your kind (fellow human beings) who have come
 into goods and riches through their own power; but you do not regret your wrong doing, but rather punish
 yourselves painfully with further hatred although it would be better for you with remorse because you would
 create a world in yourselves which would be your friend and helper for a good existence (life), in equitableness
 (fairness) and love, in inner freedom, in inner peace and in consonance (harmony).
75) Truly, if you would make a bond with the truth and turn yourselves to the truthfulness of the laws and recom-
 mendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation), then you could knowingly (consciously) gain love from a
 fullness (abundance) of fruitfulness of the primal power (Creation), so that you would not have to search for
 alms (gifts) of the life, which you do not find because you are ones who have contempt for the truth, unfair
 ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones).
76) And truly, if you could, in your inequity (unfairness), knowingly (consciously) gain love out of the fullness (abun-
 dance) of the fruitfulness of the primal power (Creation), then you would be stinting with it and want to have
 everything just for yourselves alone, without giving any to people of your kind (fellow human beings), because
 you have an aversion to them
77) You unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), you pay back all kindhearted-
 ness that is given to you with hypocrisy and with evil deeds, but consider that one day you will meet the truth
 with might to which you must give your promise that henceforth you will only follow the way of equitableness
 (fairness) and no longer lie, slander (calumniate) or be inequitable (irresponsible).
78) Truly, you unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), place your trust in the true prophets because they know the secrets of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life
(Creation); and therefore you shall build on the confidential counsels (talks) of the true prophets because they
 are the best knowers of what is hidden of the laws and recommendations of the appearance (nature) and of
 the fertilisation of the life (Creation).
79) And you unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), do not rebuke the ones
 who are knowing of the truth, the fair ones (responsible ones) and not the righteous ones (conscientious ones)
 who voluntarily and in honesty give alms (gifts) for the poor and needy; and do not disdain and ridicule those
 who cannot give any alms (gifts), because they only have the earnings from their work and have to live off this.
80) If you unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) want to become fair (respon-
 sible) and righteous (conscientious), then create forgiveness (reconciliation) in yourselves and then also ask for-
 giveness from those whom you have ridiculed, because it is only through finding forgiveness (reconciliation) in
 yourselves that you can take the way rightfully.
81) If you do not want to remain behind (persist in the old) and not continue to live in unright, then you are not
 allowed to remain behind the back (the teaching) of the prophets and sit still (learn nothing) and remain in-
 clined towards (ready for) what is without law and without recommendation.
82) And if you do not incline (bend) towards the truth in its entirety (entirely), then you will laugh little and have
 to cry a lot as reward for what you acquire of evil in yourselves.
83) You shall never turn yourselves away from the truth of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of
 the life (Creation) and never fight (battle) against the truth as an enemy, because otherwise you will remain
 behind (not come closer to the truth).
84) And do not be resentful if people of your kind (fellow human beings) have done terrible things, rather forgive
 them and let everything be forgotten when it sinks into the past, so that you do not bring it back to the light
 of day anew, and you are not reproachful (incriminating) if there is no necessity for it; and also do not be
 resentful if a person of your kind (fellow human being) dies, and do not slander him, just as you shall not de-
 file a grave either; consider, that if someone has died then he or she can no longer do anything in his or her
 defence, therefore it is a disgracefulness (defilement) to slander the deceased or to defile their graves.
85) Do not be amazed about people of your kind (fellow human beings) if they have goods and riches, because it is not for you to decide whether they have worked for, acquired (inherited) or won their goods and their riches
rightfully; and do not be covetous (jealous/envious) of the goods and the riches of others, so that you do not
depart (fall away) from the goodwill (recognition) for those others who have more goods and riches than you.
86) And if a truth is disclosed to you, then do not fight against it, rather search for the true value in it so that you
 may understand it and act according to it.
87) And be at all times satisfied together, man and woman, when you are connected to one another (married) so
 that you do not seal (close) yourselves off from one another and do not behave towards one another in aver-
 sion (weariness), and neither hating nor harming in any other wise.
88) And do not quarrel with one another as people of your kind (human beings) because you are not of the same
 opinion, and do not quarrel about your goods or about your riches, because only goodness shall be granted
 to you as people of your kind (human beings) so that it may go well with you.
89) Prepare in yourselves, in your inner nature, gardens of joy and of the highest happiness, so that you may have
 streams of true love and inner freedom as well as of inner peace and consonance (harmony) streaming through
 you.
90) Never search for pretexts if you have to adhere to something, so that you remain honest and give equitable-
 ness (fairness) enough consideration.
91) If you are weak ones (disabled ones) or sick ones and have nothing to give (donate), then no reproach shall
 strike you if you are upright and fair (moderate) as well as righteous (conscientious), because there is no cause
 for scolding against you if you do rightfully, but nevertheless cannot give (donate) anything.
92) Truly, if you do rightfully in all things then nothing will be found for which you could be rebuked; therefore do
 not allow your eyes to flood with tears either out of grief when you cannot find anything that you can give
 (donate).
93) There is only cause for reproach for those who are beseeching you for alms (gifts) and donations (hand-outs)
 despite themselves having many goods and riches, so that they can pile up a greater store of goods and enrich
 themselves even more.
94) Truly, heed (be careful of) the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and the unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones)
 when they want to take alms (gifts) and hand-outs (donations) from you, therefore you shall not lend them
 your ears if they present excuses to you.
95) They swear to you many deceitful oaths (false oaths) that you shall not leave them to fend for themselves, but
 do not heed them because they only want to deceive you; but if they do need your help in any wise, then do
 not hold yourselves back and do help them, but when doing this make sure that they do not receive a hand-
 out (donation) from you if they have sufficient from what they earned themselves.
 96) The unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) deceitfully swear oaths (false
 oaths) to you, that you shall be satisfied with them, but you cannot be satisfied with them because of their
 false oath (perjury) and their hypocrisy, because as they commit an outrage against you (treat you banefully),
 they are only exploiting you, therefore you shall have to be concerned to clarify everything and to act rightfully
 so that you are not harmed.
97) People of your kind (human beings) who unrestrainedly commit bloody deeds (mass murders) as boundless
 killers (mass murderers), whether they be individuals from the people or rulers, they are the worst amongst all
 people of your kind (humankind), and truly they are greatest hypocrites and the most obdurate against the
 truth of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation), against love of the next one
 (love for the next one), against freedom and consonance (harmony) and against peace amongst people of your
 kind (human beings); they lead a villainous life in unknowledge of the truth of the primal power (Creation),
 the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, and they make their own laws and
 standard measures (regulations) on which they insist and through which they conduct their deadly dominance
 (rule).
98) And the boundless killers (mass murderers) are miserable creatures who regard all the values of the truth and
 of dignity as well as the kindheartedness and benevolence (humanity) of people of your kind as coerced atone-
 ment, therefore they only wait for you to perform a mischance so that they can commit outrages (torture) on
 you and kill (murder) you.
99) But all you amongst people of your kind (humankind), you should be concerned at all times that you do not
 tolerate any boundless killers (mass murderers) amongst you, whether they be individuals amongst you or
 rulers, and if some do indeed arise amongst you then you shall practise gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit by catch-
 ing them and sending them to a suitable and special place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded island/secluded
 place) in banishment for the term of their life as a fair (commensurate) punishment, without the possibility of
 return amongst people of your kind (society); but allow equitableness (fairness) to prevail over them so that
 they have the opportunity to provide for their provision (food/clothing, etc.) in a strict (hard) wise and to learn
 the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and therefore also the truth of the
 laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life, so that they may approach the truth and follow it;
 truly, doubtlessly this is the only possibility for boundless killers (mass murderers) to approach a life and to
 change themselves to the good, so that they no longer kill (murder), but truly there is no staunchness (certainty)
 that boundless killers (mass murderers) will change to the better and good, and to the truth-teaching there-
 fore it is provided in any case that they shall be ostracised (banished) for the term of their life.
100) The foremost ones (administrators of the authority/government) of a people shall only be people of your kind
 (fellow human beings) which the people itself elects according to its best knowledge and best admonishment
 (conscience) so that only people of your kind (fellow human beings) are called (elected) to the authority
 (office/government/administration) who are in all respects upright (of integrity), fair (responsibility-conscious)
 and righteous (conscientious); and therefore the called ones (elected ones) shall be modest, assiduous (hard-
 working) and skilful (adept) in the leadership (guidance) of people of your kind (human beings) and in all affairs
 of the people.
101) Amongst people of your kind (fellow human beings) there are many hypocrites who believe in gods and tin
 gods and who propound (claim) that they are good believers, but truthly, you are obdurate in your belief
 (assumption) and in your hypocrisy and you follow the delusional lies and slanders (calumnies) of your priests
 and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods who present to you false teachings as illusions which they
 fabulate (invent) or have learned through false prophets; and in your obdurateness of your false belief (assump-
 tions), you assume (regard) yourselves to be better than others and set yourselves above people of your kind
 (fellow human beings) although you do terrible and evil things and therefore infringe against the laws and
 recommendations of the fertilisation of the life.
102) You do not admit your blame, and you mix one evil action with another even worse and think that people of
 your kind (fellow human beings) shall take pity upon you if you fall into hardship and misery.
103) And you take alms (gifts) despite you having great possessions or a good livelihood (subsistence), so that you
 enrich yourselves thereby and steal bread from the poor and needy, do unrightful and evil things, whilst at the
 same time passing yourselves off as good believers in your godliness (religion) or sub-godliness (sects/cult) and
 openly (publicly) praying to your gods or tin gods in order to assuage your admonishment (conscience) and in
 order to appear brilliant amongst people of your kind (fellow human beings); and you fallaciously believe that
 you are thereby refined (purified/unblemished) and that you obtain the affection of your gods and tin gods,
 the servants of gods and servants of tin gods as well of people of your kind (fellow human beings).
104) Know that all of this is only lies and deception and that you do not achieve liberation (honesty) in yourselves
 if you are not truthfully remorseful, if you do not lose yourselves in thinking about your gods and tin gods and
 you do not lend your ears to your servants of gods and servants of tin gods who lead you into the greatest
 erroneous assumption to which you could fall prey.
 105) Act only in the name of the truth and liberate yourselves from your belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods,
 in servants of gods and servants of tin gods and from belief (assumptions) in those who raise themselves up
 amongst people of your kind (human beings) as gods or as their envoys or appointees (substitutes); act (live)
 out of yourselves in equitableness (fairness), righteousness (conscientiousness), as fair ones (responsible ones),
 so that you can look at your own good deeds which you learn through the real truth and through the teaching
 of the prophets who make you into ones who are knowing of the truth and show (reveal) to you the way upon
 which you escape from all untruth and from the false teachings of the false prophets who lie that they are
 bringing you the truth, but are however lying to you and spreading delusional teachings (fallacious teachings);
 follow only the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because it is only from
 it that you learn everything that is concealed and revealed (clarified) of the laws and recommendations of the
 fertilisation of the life (Creation) and of its appearance (nature), as the true prophets teach you, and as they
 do themselves.
106) And truly, if you postpone your going on the way and assume (believe) that you can also take it later, then this
 is a poor decision because the more time passes until you take the way, the more difficult it will be for you
 because you punish yourselves thereby in your inner nature by becoming ever more negligent and by moving
 yourselves farther and farther away from the way of the truth, as a result of which in the end you can no longer
 find any pity for yourselves in yourselves.
107) And it does not help you if you are unknowing of the truth and are hypocrites and you build temples (houses
 of gods and houses of tin gods) for the spreading of the truth whilst however practising rites of gods (god
 cults) and rites of tin gods (tin god cults) therein against the truth, which are against the truthly truth of the
 laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and attempt to harm these, in order to further
 unknowledgeness of the truth and to bring partedness amongst the rows of the ones who are knowing of the
 truth, as well as to create an ambuscade for those who are searching for the truth; and truly, even if you swear
 that you are only doing good deeds by building such temples (houses of gods and houses of tin gods), then
 the truth bears witness against it (contrary witness) and reveals that you are only liars because in your temples
 (houses of gods and houses of tin gods) and in other houses that you build for your gods and tin gods, you
 do not teach the teaching of the truthly laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation),
 but rather your false teachings of your false prophets and fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods.
108) And you upright ones and like-minded ones concerning the truth, you truth-knowers amongst people of your
 kind (human beings), it is said to you that you shall never stand in such temples (houses of gods and houses
 of tin gods) and that you shall not pray in them, because they are founded upon godlinesses (religions) and
 upon sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) and only serve to lead people of your kind (human beings) into great erro-
 neous assumption and into the clutches of the servants of gods and servants of tin gods and their fabulated
 (invented) gods and tin gods so that you become servile (dependent) on them and that you may be exploited
 in your goods and riches; and truly it is only of dignity to uphold your knowledge of the truth-teaching out-
 side such places rather than standing or sitting in such places and being lied to by the priests and worshippers
 of gods and worshippers of tin gods; man, woman and child, be of dignity in your knowledge of the truth-
 teaching, as it is given through the true prophets who have worked it out from the truthly laws and recom-
 mendations of the appearance (nature) of the fertilisation of the life (Creation).
109) Do not think that those who have fallen prey to a belief (assumptions) in the fear of gods and tin gods are bet-
 ter than the ones who are knowing of the truth, because truly, godly (religious) belief is never founded on
 delight in the truth, rather the godly (religious) belief is like a house built on the edge of a rolling, undermined
 sandbank and which can never have the firmness (safety) of a house built on rock with its foundation walls
 anchored in the rock.
110) And truly, the house, the truth which is built on rock (firmness) and is anchored in the foundations of the rock,
 does not contain any doubt in itself and cannot be torn into pieces.
111) Those who build their house, their belief (assumptions) on undermined sand, they are fighting against the truth
 of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), and therefore they are not the same as the
 ones who are knowing of the truth, the fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones),
 rather they are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) who demand out -
 rage (torture), punishment and death for people of their kind whenever fallibilities (errors) are committed, so
 they also do not hesitate to wage battles (wars) and to accurse people of your kind (human beings) if they have
 more goods and are richer, if they are of a different skin colour, of a different attitude (mentality) and a differ-
 ent godliness (religion/belief); they do not follow the recommendation of the truth-teaching that the promise
 of people of your kind (human beings) is the regulation (duty) of the love for the next one and that all people
 shall also for themselves fulfil the promise of the love in themselves to the best extent.
112) And only if you fulfil the promise of the regulation (duty) and create truthly love in yourselves, when you turn away from the lovelessness towards yourselves and towards people of your kind (fellow human beings) in
remorse, and when you no longer pray to gods and tin gods and you no longer bow down and cast yourselves
down before them and before the servants of gods and servants of tin gods, but when you change yourselves to the real truth and demand (direct) right in yourselves and forbid what is unright, so that you heed the divid- ing lines (boundaries) that are given through the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), and if you heed the joyful message of the truth-teaching through the true prophets, only then are you on the way to the equitableness (fairness) and righteousness (conscientiousness) in order to become fair ones (respon- sible ones).
113) Truly, it is not appropriate either for you nor for the true prophets to supplicate (request) forgiveness or to grant
 forgiveness in any wise to believers in gods and tin gods, servants of gods and servants of tin gods and even
 for the nearest family members, because the believers in gods and tin gods or demons only can do this for
 themselves if they turn away from their erroneous assumption of belief (assumptions) and clearly proclaim to
 themselves that they will henceforth only be connected to the truthly truth of the laws and recommendations
 of the primal power (Creation).
114) Therefore, no father and no mother can supplicate forgiveness for their children because of their belief
 (assumptions) in gods or tin gods, just as the children cannot do this either for their parents, and the man can-
 not do it for a woman or a woman for a man, because all people of your kind (human being) must liberate
 themselves from their belief (assumptions) in gods or tin gods through their own true discernment (intellect)
 and through their own insight (rationality), in order to be able to forgive themselves.
115) Truly, it is not in the sense of the truth and of the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Cre-
 ation) to allow people of your kind (human beings) to go into confusion, rather the sense is given that you are
 guided (led) by them; but consider, all amongst you must yourselves take efforts to search for, recognise (see) and
 follow the creational laws and recommendations in the appearance (nature) of the fertilisation of the life
 (Creation) through the teaching of the true prophets; be certain (knowing) that you must steer (guide) yourselves,
 because you are your own guardians, as well as being the guardians of people of your kind (next ones) so that it
 may go well with all of you.
116) To you is given the kingdom of Earth, as well as the kingdom of the firmaments (universe) and of earths
 (worlds/planets) so that you may protect everything well and make it a place of happiness (paradise) in its en-
 tirety (entirely); but you have not been given the might of death, so you shall not decide over it, but give death
 its due when it calls on you of its own accord; do not bring about death unrightfully by killing (murdering) people
 of your kind (human beings) or yourselves, rather you shall be at all times a friend and helper to life; to you is
 merely given the might to create life within the dividing lines (boundaries) of the laws and recommendations of
 the fertilisation of the life (Creation), therefore between man and woman and, in the case of other creatures
 (life forms), between the male and female by raising (breeding) and modifying (crossing) as well as through repli-
 cation (gene manipulation) which you may also use with regard to fruits and vegetables, and all things through
 which you facilitate much of your existence (life).
117) Therefore, you are taught through the teaching of the prophets that you may turn yourselves to everything
 that is knowingly (recognisably) given to you through the truth of the laws and recommendations of the appear-
 ance (nature) of the fertilisation of the life (Creation), as well as to everything that is unknown (unrecognis-
 able) and concealed to you, but which you can however fathom and make useful for yourselves; therefore
 open your ears to the teaching of the prophets, because it is through them that many concealed things of the
 laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) are proclaimed (announced) to you, so that you
 may be aware of (feel) the secrets that are within them (disclose them) and be progressive.
118) And beware of breeding too many of people of your kind (human beings) so that the breadth of the earth
 does not become too narrow for you and there is no longer any refuge for you on it; therefore do not turn in
 pity to those who want to create descendants if there are too many of all the people of your kind (human-
 kind), otherwise a cataclysm (catastrophe) is unavoidable when the appearance (nature) turns against you and
 you can no longer do anything about it; truly, the number of all people of your kind (humankind) is restricted
 for your world, but as you exceed the number then calamities of all kinds sweep over you, which you can no
 longer control.
119) All who are fruitful in (bear) true discernment (rationality) and insight (intellect), consider that you shall show
 esteem and honour (respect) to the appearance (nature) of your world and shall keep it in health and benevo-
 lence so that your world does not suffer its downfall (is not destroyed) through you.
120) It is not seemly for you as inhabitants of Earth that you commit misdemeanours against it and destroy it in itself
 and in its appearance (nature) through your might and undiscernment (irrationality); but if you do this, then
 you make yourselves into enemies of your world, which is your home, from which will spring misery, hardship
 and affliction for you, which must be ascribed to you as a disparaging (despicable) work; and truly your reward
 for this is terrible cataclysms (catastrophes) with enormous destruction and wholesale (mass) deaths of people
 of your kind (human beings).
121) And if you subject your world to an ordeal (torture), then you cannot give any amount (sum/money), whether great or small, to ward off the resulting calamity, because all the cataclysms (catastrophes) will be so great that
you will no longer be able to resolve them, therefore the blame for it must be laid at your door, for which you will receive your reward of terrible things heaped upon terrible things and calamity upon calamity.
122) And if the time comes when you subject your world to an ordeal (torture), then many will have to leave their
 homes and lose their goods and chattels, and great throngs will flee from high waters and great storms, and
 much misery, hardship, affliction and many deaths will spread (be rampant); and if you do not open your ears
 to the admonishments (warnings) of the true prophets, who are adept in (know) many things of the time to
 come (future) and in the creational laws and recommendations of the appearance (nature), then great calamity
 and terrible things will come over you; therefore may you beware of the threatening terrible things and calamity
 and heed the admonishing words (warnings) of the prophets.
123) Truly, those of you who think that you must fight against the admonishments (warnings) of the prophets and
 accuse (blame) them of lying, it will go terribly with you, because you will find yourselves in the harshness of
 calamity, as is told to you by the prophets.
124) No matter how many times you are told the truth, you cast it into the wind, and you do not allow your paucity
 of knowledge and your paucity of wisdom to be strengthened through the teaching of the prophets, because
 you assume (believe) yourselves to be thinking (prudent) and full of true discernment (rationality) and insight
 (intellect) and take delight in this, whereby you suffer harm time and time again, wage battles (wars) and spread
 death, affliction, misery and destruction.
125) And consider, if you subject the appearance (nature) of your world to an ordeal (torture), then you and your
 animals and many other creatures will also fall victim to new illnesses and scourges (plagues), and one illness
 and scourge (plague) will usher in the next one, because it is through your own blame that you allow one ter-
 rible thing and calamity to follow on the heels of the next one, just as when you have dirt and add further dirt
 and it becomes rife.
126) Beware of this and see that the terrible things and calamity do not befall you, otherwise you will be harshly
 afflicted if you do not regret your false actions and you do not allow yourselves to be admonished.
127) And truly, even since the time before you, it has been the case that you do not allow yourselves to be admon-
 ished and you merely look at one another and laugh about the admonishments (warnings) of the prophets,
 just as you also turn away from them because you do not want to understand.
128) Your awakening, however, will be a painful one if you do not listen to the admonishments (warnings) and to
 the advices of the true prophets, but only to the falsehoods (deviousness) of the false prophets and the lies
 and slanders (calumny) of the hypocrites who present themselves as servants of gods and servants of tin gods;
 and if you do fall into calamity, then do not wait for kindheartedness and benevolence (humanity) from your
 gods and tin gods or your demons, because just as they are only powerless hazy pictures (fantasies), they do
 not have any power either to bring you help no matter how arduously you make entreaties to them, pray and
 kneel down before them.
129) However, if you turn yourselves away from your wrong doing, lend your ears to the true prophets and give
 enough consideration to the laws and recommendations of the fertilisation of the life (Creation) and trust in
 the mightiness of its guidelines (guiding principles) and its power, then it will go well with you and you will not
 be struck by the terrible things and the calamities about which you have been admonished (warned).
