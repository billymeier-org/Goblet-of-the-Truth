# Chapter 12
1) These are the words of the teaching of the prophets that is given to you as the teaching of the truth, teaching
 of the spirit, teaching of the life.
2) The words of the teaching of the prophets is the teaching of the truth of the laws and recommendations of
 the unfolding of BEING (Creation = unfolding = becoming, BEING = existence), and it is given to you so that
 you may understand the existence (life) and all things that are connected to it.
3) And the truth-teaching is proclaimed (announced) to you so that the hidden things of the primal (creational)
 laws and recommendations may be revealed to you, so that you learn to know how you shall bear (conduct)
 yourselves in your existence (life).
4) Truly, instead of you showing deference (honourableness) to the unfolding of BEING (Creation), you worship
 names (titles) and gods and tin gods which you yourselves fabulate (invent) and for which you have no autho-
 risation of any kind; you alone have decided and demanded yourselves to fabulate (invent) gods and tin gods
 and high names (titles), to pray to them and to worship them, however this is not the way of the truth, even
 if most of the people of your kind (human beings) are caught up in this doing (indulge in this doing).
5) Therefore, against all the truth of freedom, you are genuflecting (suppliantly falling on your knees) before your fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods and names (titles), so that you disregard the truthly freedom of people
of your kind (human beings), as is taught to you through the primal (creational) laws and recommendations.
6) And you have created prejudice (partiality) amongst yourselves, so that you give wine to one and deliver the
 other to death, depending on what you think will be the most convenient (advantageous) for you; and you
 decide on this in vanity (imperiousness) over all right and over the truth of the primal (creational) laws and
 recommendations.
7) Consider, through the laws and recommendations of the unfolding of BEING (Creation), you are given the
 might over everything so that you guide (use) it rightly and do not make your own laws and recommendations
 that are against those of the unfolding of BEING (Creation); therefore if you make your own laws and recom-
 mendations then they shall be in harmony with the primal (creational) ones.
8) Truly, you have the dominance over everything, but use it according to right and the law, as everything proceeds
 from the laws and recommendations of the unfolding of BEING (Creation), so that you do not create right in
 unright or law in lawlessness.
9) To you are also given cognition (rationality) and true discernment (intellect) so that you can comprehend
 (understand) the right explanation of the primal (creational) laws and recommendations and can act accord-
 ingly, so that you are protectors of yourselves and protectors of all people of your kind (humanity), as well as
 of all kinds of life (life forms), of the firmaments (universe), your world and all earths (worlds/planets) and all
 lights in the firmament (stars/comets/nebulas).
10) To you is given the power (rationality and intellect) so that you may research into the hidden nature of the
 primal (creational) laws and recommendations and that you may direct yourselves according to the tidings
 (message/teaching) that is given to you through the true prophets.
 11) Therefore turn yourselves towards the truthly truth and do not foment intrigues (guilefulness) against it, be-
 cause just as you do not like intrigues (guilefulness) against yourselves, so you shall also not like wanting to
 devalue the truth through intrigues (guilefulness).
12) Truly, most of those amongst you are not particularly well-versed in the truth and in its benefit (success), so
 that most diligently wish to achieve their intentions through untruth (lying) and unright, which is however
 directed against the primal (creational) laws and recommendations and for this reason brings harm to all in its
 time, because the truth cannot be deceived and comes to the light which discovers all untruth (lying) and all
 unright.
13) Therefore do not unrightfully demand a reward (payment) for any things whatsoever that are of unright, so
 that you do not heedlessly pass over equitableness (fairness) and you do not turn yourselves away from the
 admonishment through the truth.
14) And do not raise yourselves up as gods as you raise up gods and tin gods over yourselves in a fabulating
 (inventing) wise, so that you will not be worshipped by people of your kind (human beings) as you worship
 your fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, who can neither benefit you nor harm you, in contrast to those
 whom you raise up into gods as people of your kind (human beings), who subdue (master) you, exploit you
 and make you into submissive slaves in bondage and without will, and believing in them.
15) And if you turn to the truth then it does not demand any reward from you if you follow it, rather it is a great
 honour for all people of your kind (human beings) if you turn to it and follow it.
16) And there are many signs (much evidence) in the appearance (nature) of your world as well as in the firma-
 ments (universe) and on the earths (worlds/planets) and in all lights in the firmament (stars/comets/nebulas) for
 the reality of the primal (creational) truth, which you are recommended to follow; and you shall not pass over
 these signs (this evidence) of the unfolding of BEING (Creation) heedlessly, nor turn yourselves away from
 them.
17) Truly, many amongst you do not heed the signs (evidence) of the truth of the presence (existence) of the un -
 folding of BEING (Creation) and of its laws and recommendations, which is why you place fabulated (invented)
 gods and tin gods at its side, to whom you senselessly pray, as also unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and
 unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) amongst you raise themselves up as fabulated (invented) god(s) and
 have you offer worship and supplication to them.
18) However, do not feel secure with your gods and tin gods because they can neither benefit you nor harm you,
 and therefore neither can they protect you, just as they cannot keep you safe from the terrible things that you
 yourselves create in your inner world (consciousness), in your psyche, in your inner nature and in your indi-
 viduality (character) if you go along far away from (off the way of) truth and turn yourselves as unfair ones
 (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) to all terrible things, through which you crea-
 te hatred and jealousy, as well as battles (wars) and bloody deeds (murder), unfreedom (bondage), peaceless-
 ness and dissonance (disharmony); truly, you will suffer great harm and pain, affliction, hardship and misery
 through this if suddenly the hour of disaster comes (breaks in) over you without you suspecting anything.
19) Therefore, it is recommended to you that you follow the straight and secure way of the truth, and lead your
 lives on the basis of secure cognisance of the primal (creational) laws and recommendations, that you solely
 follow these and do not worship any gods and tin gods.
20) Listen to the true prophets and follow the teaching of the prophets who give you revelations regarding the
 unfolding of BEING (Creation) and of its laws and recommendations.
21) Do not think that the true prophets are lying to you, because they bring you true help for leading your existen-
 ce (life), so that you may save yourselves from all the terrible things and disaster which you create out of your-
 selves and harm (worry) yourselves with.
22) Truly, the teaching of the prophets shows the way that you must take if you strive in cognition (rationality) and
 true discernment (intellect) to go along on it; the teaching of the prophets and their words are no fabulated
 (invented) speech, but rather a fulfilment of what the prophets recognised out of the primal (creational) laws
 and recommendations as their duty and which they bring to you as a clear explanation of all things, so that
 you may become knowing (conscious) and wise through following the sole truth that is given in the signs (evi-
 dence) of the presence of the unfolding of BEING (Creation) and of its laws and recommendations and which
 is substantive (visible).
