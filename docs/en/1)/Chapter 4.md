# Chapter 4
1) Oh, you people of your kind (human beings), do not be afraid of the truth, neither of the laws and recommen- dations of the wellspring of all life (Creation), because only in them is true love and equitableness (fairness).
2) You have been created in your origin from the wellspring of all life (Creation), and you have made yourselves
 companions as man and wife and have multiplied; heed one another and be afraid of doing unright to one
 another so that you may be good to one another and make requests instead of issuing commands; uphold the
 bonds of relationship between one another, because both as woman and as man you have entered into life as
 people of your kind (human beings), therefore amongst you the only differences are the body, sex and the
 nature (thought-world/feeling-world/character), actions and behaviour, feelings, the power, the attraction
 (charms) and the capability (ability) of pregnancy; truly, as woman and man are in inequality (difference) in
 these things, yet in existence they have common duties and rights so that neither the man shall stand above
 the woman in any things nor the woman above the man; and just as man and woman undertake the same
 work, so they shall receive their wages equally so that neither the man nor the woman is paid more than the
 other for the same labours.
3) Truly, equitableness (fairness) is when man and woman grant each other the same duties and rights, although
 it shall be rightful for the one party who has the greater proficiency (empowerment) for certain duties and
 rights to be involved more for these.
4) And it is rightful that congress (sexual intercourse) between man and woman shall only be permitted if con-
 sent is granted; if however the woman or the man is induced into congress (sexual intercourse) by Gewalt,
 then a defilement (violation) is carried out which shall result (be prosecuted) by right and law with a fulfilment
 of guidelines (punishment).
5) And as you create descendants, it shall be done in the measure of insight (rationality) so that the standard mea-
 sure of the number of all peoples (humankind) does not get out of control in a very bad wise and result in
 immoderateness (overpopulation) and the world and its weathers, the appearance (nature) and all life on Earth
 do not suffer great and lasting damage (destruction of the environment/destruction of the climate/extinction
 of forms of life/wars/crimes, etc.); therefore, the recommendation of insight (rationality) and of control over
 extent is given for obedience (following) so that no calamity may come over you and your world; consequently,
 it is recommended that you keep yourselves within bounds (limits) and manage (monitor) the standard mea-
 sure of the number of all peoples and that you undertake (carry out) a measurement (census) every certain
 number of years so that the measure of all inhabitants of Earth does not become too great and remains within
 the number of the maintainable (supportable) without leading to harm (529 million).
6) And if you have orphans then give them their possessions which belong to them and do not exchange good
 things for bad, and do not live off (steal) their possessions in order to combine them with your own, because
 such actions are unrightful and despicable and mark you out as unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unright-
 eous ones (conscienceless ones) if you do them.
7) If you are afraid of not being fair to orphans and of doing wrong towards them, then learn from the laws and
 recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and from the truth-teaching of the true prophets
 which way you must take and what actions you must use in order to be fair to the orphans; and if there are
 orphans who can be taken by people in union (married couple) or by a woman or man alone as their own
 (adopted), then it is rightful for the children to be rightfully provided with everything necessary and given
 instruction (education), which shall be inspected (checked) by the authority; if there are half-orphans, without
 a father or mother, then do a noble deed and take the half-orphans to be your own when you enter into a
 bond (marriage) with the mother or the father, so that the children may have a true father or a true mother in
 love; and if you join with (marry) the mothers or the fathers of half-orphans then behave equally towards the
 children without any difference as if you had begot them yourselves; if however you have to fear that you act
 inequitably, then do not enter into either the bond (marriage) or taking the children as your own (adopting
 them) because that is the simplest wise for you to avoid unright.
8) And if you have orphans who are living in places for orphans (orphanages) or for whom you are caring (foster parents) and who are growing up with you and are provided for and brought up by you then care for them
until they have grown out of youth (grown up); and if you perceive understanding and obligation (respon-
sibility) with them in good measure in all things when they have grown up (come of age) then issue them with
their possessions so that they may decide what to do with them themselves; and take care that you do not swindle them by claiming the orphans’ possessions for your own; however also make sure that the orphans, when they have grown out of their youth (grown up) and come to their possessions, do not consume them hastily or wastefully; and it is rightful, if the orphans receive (inherit) great wealth from their parents, the parents of their parents (grandparents) or the godparents (sponsors), for the places for orphans or you as foster parents to live on it according to equitableness (approval/fairness); if however the places of orphans or you as foster parents are wealthy then it is rightful for the orphans’ possessions not to be used; and when you give the orphans their possessions, have witnesses in their presence and also have the issue of the possessions recorded in an accreditation (receipt) which is sufficient for the reckoning.
9) Indeed, if you consume the possessions of orphans unrightfully, then you are only swallowing fire and smoke, and you will burn with flaming fire in your innner when your admonishment (conscience) calls you to account.
10) And you, man and woman, who are in a bond (marriage), give one another voluntarily and benevolently gifts
 of thanks for this and that, whether it be an embrace, a flower, a caress or whatever else that speaks of thanks
 and love and esteem; in the bond (marriage), share everything out of your own free will amongst yourselves
 and enjoy everything as delight and pleasure in mutual inclination.
11) And if you have irrational ones (deranged/feeble-minded ones) amongst you then you shall not allow them to
 conjoin (marry), neither shall you yourselves enter into a bond with them; and if you are the keepers (carers)
 of irrational ones (deranged/feeble-minded ones) then do not entrust them with your goods and fortune for
 their welfare but nourish them with it and clothe them and speak friendly words to them, just as you shall be
 helpful with advice and deeds.
12) Both the man and the woman are due a certain proportion of that which parents and close relatives leave
 behind, whether it is little or much, depending on the allotments made by the leavers-behind (bequeathers) in
 a document of assignment (last will); the fair (tolerable) rule for dividing up the heritable goods, chattels and
 wealth is that in the event of a bond (marriage), the surviving woman or surviving man shall receive two parts
 (2/3) of all the goods and chattels and of the entire fortune and wealth, whilst the other part (1/3) shall be
 apportioned to the surviving children in equal shares; if the father and mother lose their life then their entire
 heritable goods, chattels and wealth shall be apportioned to the descendants in equal shares and if there are
 descendants from previous bonds (first marriage, second marriage, etc.) then they shall be entitled to even
 shares with the descendants from the last bond (marriage) in the heritable goods, chattels and wealth of the
 person in the bond (marriage partner) who is their parent (mother or father).
13) If a deceased's heritable goods, chattels and wealth (heritage) have to be distributed, then it is rightful for any
 debts and other payments to be settled first before any distribution amongst the descendants; and know that
 your wife or your husband, as well as your fathers, mothers and children are always closest to you, wherefore
 this establishment of the heritage is given in this wise so that equitableness (fairness) and equality may be
 upheld amongst all.
14) If, however, a man and a woman are in a bond (marriage) and do not have children, and the woman or the
 man dies, then the entire heritage belongs to the surviving partner (man or woman); and if people without a
 bond (unmarried people) or descendants (family) die and they do not have any children then their entire heritage
 shall be apportioned equally amongst their brothers and sisters; and if there are none of these either then their
 place shall be taken by the next closest relatives; and if children, sons and daughters, die who do not have their
 own family then their entire heritage shall fall to their parents, or in any case half of the entire heritage if a
 document of assignment (last will) decrees something different for the other half.
15) And if brothers and sisters die when both parents have already died, and if none of the brothers and sisters
 are in a bond (marriage) and if none of them have any descendants then all shall receive equal shares in the
 entire heritage of the deceased, however at least half of the entire heritage if a document of assignment (last
 will) decrees something different for the other half.
16) And because of equality and equitableness (fairness), it is not permitted for any reason whatsoever for entitled
 ones (ones entitled to inherit) of heritages to be disadvantaged by a document of assignment (last will) or ex-
 cluded from the heritage.
17) And it is decreed for your children that female and male children shall receive equal shares of the goods and
 chattels and the wealth of the leavers-behind (bequeathers), mother or father, so that no more shall be appor-
 tioned to one party than to another, and that equality and equitableness (fairness) may be given and neither
 the female nor the male descendant be preferred.
18) And if other relatives and poor ones or orphans are present at the allocation of the heritable goods, chattels and wealth (dividing up of the heritage), and if they are not taken into account therein, then give them something
from that which you receive as inheritance, and speak with them in kindheartedness and with friendly words; if
however you receive an inheritance, then you shall not fall into dispute amongst yourselves because of it, for it is
rightful for each of you to be satisfied with the share that is granted to you by the leaver-behind (bequeather).
19) And those amongst you who cannot yourselves leave any heritage when you depart this life, you shall not be afraid for this reason or concerned because there are no grounds for shame, and it prevents much dispute.
20) These are the guidelines and set barriers derived from the recommendations of equality and equitableness (fair-
 ness) so that equality and equitableness (fairness), but no disadvantage, may prevail all around, and so that
 neither strife nor resentment and neither jealousy nor acts of revenge may come about amongst entitled ones
 (ones entitled to inherit) from those left behind (family).
21) However, anyone who transgresses these recommendations of regulation and reckoning is not only creating a
 calamity in themselves but also all around amongst those who are involved, therefore disparagement (con-
 temptibility/defilement/abasement/dishonour) will not fail to come about.
22) And if a man or a woman amongst you commits chastisement (violation) by defiling (misusing/violating) chil-
 dren or a woman or a man at their sexual organ, then call for witnesses and request the jurisdiction to subject
 the fallible ones to fulfilment of guidelines as punishment, and separate women from men or men from
 women (exclude from society and from the other sex) for an appropriate time.
23) And if two women amongst you or a man and a man have congress together (engage in sexual union) then
 they shall not be punished, because a woman and a woman in sexual congress (sexual union) is given by the
 laws of appearance (nature) so that they may copulate together if the need arrives; however if a man and a
 man have sexual congress with one another then that is against the law of appearance (nature) in such a wise
 (unnatural) because they cannot copulate fruitfully to produce offspring, but it is in the law of appearance
 (nature) that sexual congress (sexual union) between man and man is natural (unnatural naturalness) and only
 serves love and sexual satisfaction (gratification); therefore neither man and man nor woman and woman are
 committing an unright when they have sexual congress with one another (sexual union), therefore they do not
 bring down punishment on themselves, nor do they have any need for regret or improvement, so there is no
 requirement to open up a way out of their penchant (disposition), and they shall live in peace as ones with a
 different nature in sexuality (lesbians/homosexuals) amongst those who practise their sexuality between man
 and woman.
24) Truly, hard punishment and remorse for any doings only are of value if something evil is done knowingly (con-
 sciously); if something evil is done unknowingly and a law or recommendation is infringed then lenience is
 appropriate and the punishment should be set such that mild commensurability is provided.
25) Remorse cannot be accepted from those who continue in their evil doings, because they are only making a
 show of remorse and do not consider ceasing their evil doings, for which reason they shall be subject to a hard
 punishment in a place of fulfilment of guidelines (remote place or remote island) for a certain time in order to
 experience true remorse, so that they may be honestly connected to remorse and cease their evil doings.
26) Those amongst you, man and woman, who are connected to one another in a bond (marriage) in truth, equi-
 tableness (fairness) and in reckoning, it is not permitted for you to appropriate the goods and chattels and
 wealth of the other party against their will, neither shall you withhold the goods and wealth of the other party
 unlawfully or take away a part of it; and whatever you have given to one another shall not be demanded back,
 even if you are harmed by disgracefulness (badness) or if you break your bond, because a gift (present) is given
 in good memory that, given at its time, has its value and cannot be taken back, therefore demanding it back
 is the same as theft.
27) If you feel in yourselves anger or unwillingness (aversion) against the bonded companion, against man or woman,
 then also remember what goodness has been given by the other and what has been given in goodness and
 badness on your part, so that you make an assessment (pay attention/consider) from both sides in order to
 reach a truly fair (commensurate) arbitration (decision) and act in a decent wise.
28) And if you, woman and man, have already pledged (promised/vowed) a bond (marriage) to one another and
 if you nevertheless go your own ways again (separate/dissolve the betrothal), and you have already given one
 another treasures (jewels/property/presents) then do not take any of it back because a gift (present) is given in
 good memory that, given at its time, has its value and cannot be taken back, therefore demanding it back is
 the same as theft.
29) Gifts (presents) that have once been given shall remain gifts (presents) for all time and in all circumstances, and
 never be demanded back unless the one who demands back the gift (present) accuses (incriminates) himself
 or herself of having lied.
30) Truly, you cannot take back gifts (presents) from one another either if you have been alone with one another
 (joined in sexual intercourse); whether you have slept with one another (had sexual intercourse) in a fixed bond
 (marriage) or only in confidential unity (mutual liking).
 31) And it is rightful if you are not in a bond (marriage) that you lie with (have sexual intercourse with) one an-
  other in confidential unity (mutual liking), if you do not yet have a wife or a husband (you are single) and you
  have come of age (grown up), but at the same time it shall be that a touchable companionship (open friend-
  ship) exists and not however a wild disorderliness (wild promiscuity) of changing partners with whom you lie
  (have sexual intercourse); if you are however in a vow (betrothal) for a bond (marriage) to be entered into with
  another man or woman, then it is unrightful if you lie with (have sexual intercourse with) others; and it is not
  rightful if you lie with (have sexual intercourse with) one another if you are in an untouchable companionship
  (platonic friendship) with one another.
 32) And it is rightful that the woman has one man only, because it is only through one man alone that a procre-
  ation (fertilisation) for descendants can come about; a man, however, may have three women, because he is
  capable of undertaking several procreations (fertilisations) with several women, but it is given for him to be
  able to be fair to all women in all things and in their provision and in their equality; and if a man has several
  women then a bond (marriage) applies with each of them, within which the other women are also included
  and of which they also partake.
 33) And it is not rightful if people in union of a bond (marriage), with a man or woman, lie with (have sexual inter-
  course with) another man or another woman who is not included in the bond, because that is a breach of the
  bond (marriage) and shall be punished by the jurisdiction with a fulfilment of guidelines in a place of fulfilment
  of guidelines (secluded place/isolated island) for a certain time.
 34) And it is not rightful and means blood-disgrace (incest/inbreeding) to enter into a bond (marriage) with a
  woman who was intimate with (married to) your father or forefather (grandfather); therefore it is not rightful
  and amounts to blood-disgrace (incest/inbreeding) to enter into a bond (marriage) with a man who was inti-
  mate with (married to) your mother or foremother (grandmother); therefore a hard punishment shall be meted
  out by the jurisdiction if something of this kind is done (undertaken).
 35) And it is not rightful and means blood-disgrace (incest/inbreeding) if a father or mother enters into a bond
  (marriage) or lies with (has sexual intercourse with) his or her sons or daughters; therefore a hard punishment
  shall be meted out by the jurisdiction if something of this kind is done (undertaken).
 36) And it is not rightful and means blood-disgrace (incest/inbreeding) to lie with (have sexual intercourse with)
  your father or your mother, therefore a hard punishment shall be meted out by the jurisdiction if something of
  this kind is done (undertaken).
 37) And it is not rightful and means blood-disgrace (incest/inbreeding) if brothers and sisters enter into bonds (mar-
  riages) with one another or lie with (have sexual intercourse with) one another, therefore a hard punishment
  shall be meted out by the jurisdiction if something of this kind is done (undertaken).
 38) Therefore man and woman are not allowed (it is forbidden for them) to enter into a bond (marriage) or to lie with (have sexual intercourse with) their mothers and fathers, their daughters and sons and the daughters and sons of
 their own daughters and sons; and it is not allowed for man and woman (it is forbidden for them) to do so with
 their sisters and brothers as well as the sons and daughters of their brothers and the sons and daughters of their
 sisters; and the same applies to the sons and daughters of the sons and daughters of their brothers as well as to
 the children of the daughters of their sisters and the children of the sons of theirs sisters; therefore protection
 shall be granted you as far as the third generation so that no blood-disgrace (incest/inbreeding) may occur.
 39) And it is not rightful, therefore it shall not occur, that related mothers and fathers (stepfathers/stepmothers and
  adoptive fathers/adoptive mothers) lie with (have sexual intercourse with) the related children (stepchildren and
  adopted children), therefore a hard punishment shall be meted out by the jurisdiction if something of this kind
  is done (undertaken); if there are joined children (stepchildren) who are not taken as your own (not adopted) then
  their protection shall take the form of their age until the time when they come of age (grow up), following
  which they may be raised to the status of a bond (marriage) by the joined father (stepfather) or the joined mother
  (stepmother), if this is in accordance with the will of the children and that of the father and the mother.
 40) However, it is rightful if a man has several women at the same time who are sisters and he takes them into his
  hearth (home) in a bond (marriage).
 41) And it is not rightful to have congress (sexual relations) with a man or a woman if that man or woman is inti-
  mate with another man or woman in another bond (marriage).
 42) And it is rightful and allowed for you, if you are not in a bond (married) to look for a man or a woman with
  all your means of uprightness and in a noble wise, providing you do not commit any immoral and unseemly
  sexual behaviour and you enter into a bond (marriage) with the man or woman and found a clan (family); and
  it is rightful and permitted for not only man and woman to found a clan (family), but also for a woman and a
  woman and a man and a man, to whom it is also permitted to take orphaned children as their own (by adop-
  tion) so that their line (family name) may be continued.
 43) And for the joys that you receive from one another as man and woman, you shall give one another the gift of
  true love so that you always live in harmony and are good to one another.
  44) And there shall be no defilement for you in anything that you mutually agree upon, whether it concerns your
union (sexual intercourse) or your ingenious skills (practices) in this, because nothing shall be disallowed (for-
bidden) to you that you do with one another in mutual consent for your joys and your delectation.
  45) And those of you who cannot afford or do not want to enter into a certified bond (officially certified, certified
by the authority), then it is rightful for you to enter into a valid bond (marriage) without evidence (authori-
sation) from the authorities, and to have all the same rights as those who have evidence from the authority;
thus this also applies to bonds (marriages) between woman and woman and between man and man.
  46) And it is not rightful to coerce a man or a woman into a bond for whatever reason; yet hard punishment shall
be meted out by the jurisdiction if this is contravened.
  47) And if you are guilty of sexual excessiveness and fornication (sexual culpability) and of sexual enticement
(whoring) when you have entered into a bond (marriage), then the jurisdiction shall impose a hard punishment
on you as shall be prescribed by a fulfilment of guidelines; therefore the same shall also apply to those amongst
you who are only guilty of making an approach (attempt) so that you may fear the unrightful doing and hold
back because that is better for you.
  48) Therefore it is rightful if you have undertaken to be true through a bond (marriage) that you do not bring any
fornication (sexual culpability) onto yourselves and do not get involved in any harlotry (prostitution) and do not
take lovers to yourselves in secret, either a man or a woman.
  49) And do not consider taking the purity (chastity/innocence) from a man or woman out of pure revelry (sexual
urge) and lustfulness (greed), so that you can fulfil your craving (desire) and give fullness (sufficiency) to your
boastfulness amongst people of your kind (human beings).
  50) And do not debase yourselves by sexual excessiveness and fornication (sexual culpability) and sexual enticement
(whoring) by falling prey to lying with (having sexual intercourse with) partners out of drunkenness (desire) or
taking possessions and a whore’s payment.
  51) And it is recommended for you to uphold the laws of people of your kind (human beings) so that everything
will be granted to them that belongs to them, therefore also freedom, as slavery as well as other trafficking in
people of your kind (human beings) and servitude as well as bondage contravene all rights and are reprehen-
sible as well as disallowed (forbidden); you shall turn to people of your kind (fellow human beings) in kind-
heartedness and love and not harm them in any wise.
  52) You shall ease the burden of the existence for yourselves and people of your kind (fellow human beings) be-
cause you are weak through your unknowing of the truth of the primal power (Creation) and its laws and
recommendations, therefore you shall bring about assuagement for yourselves and people of your kind (human
beings) by turning yourselves to the truth-teaching, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
teaching of the life so that it may go well with you.
  53) Do not split up (share) your possessions amongst one another with illicit (forbidden) means (deception/theft);
obtain (earn) everything with honest commerce and in mutual consent.
  54) And be reputable (honest) and righteous (conscientious) to yourselves, so you shall not commit any outrage to your own body and life and not kill (murder) yourselves, neither shall you let yourselves be killed (murdered)
  by deceitful murderers; and do not kill (murder) for the sake of another’s possessions; and do not rob those
  who are going about their business (wayfarers/business people, etc.) or who carry their wealth on their person
  or keep it in their house (home); and yet whoever contravenes this law nevertheless in outrageousness and in-
  equity (unfairness) shall be severely punished by separation from men or women (cast out of society and sepa-
  rated by gender) and be excluded for a certain time through remaining in a place of fulfilment of guidelines
  (secluded place/isolated island) amongst people of their kind and in separation of the sexes (only men or only
  women) so that they may feel the fire of admonishment (conscience) in themselves and become of right sense.
  55) Keep yourselves away from the minor and the major things which are illicit (forbidden) for you, and observe
the laws and recommendations that are given in a fair (responsible) wise for the weal and for the protection
of the life of all, then you will contribute to love amongst all, as well as to peace, freedom and consonance
(harmony).
  56) And do not desire that which sets others apart or what others have created, just as you shall not desire the
possessions of another either; the things you want to have shall be created by your own power in righteous-
ness (conscientiousness), so that every man shall have his share according to his merits, and so that every
woman shall have her share according to her merits; do not be envious of things that others have more of than
you do, so that you do not become slanderers (calumniators) of them and you do not become thieves, de-
ceivers and murderers (killers) if you dare to slander them, steal from them, deceive them or rob them.
  57) Consider, each one is given everything according to his or her merits, and so it shall also be in a bond (con- tract) if you have concluded one with one another so that one party shall not be disadvantaged whilst the other
  is advantaged (receives a benefit), therefore everything shall always be regulated so that both parties receive
  the same shares and rights such that one does not have more than the other; and if you conclude a bond (con-
tract) for a deal, then it shall be such that the one who is the grantor (seller) does not give excessive advan-
tage to the receiver (purchaser) and the latter does not carry out his or her obligation to (towards) the grantor
(seller) tardily (does not discharge the responsibility).
  58) And you stand in responsibility for all things both as man and as woman, and therefore it shall also be kept
rightful in this wise if you enter into a bond (marriage) as well as if you are still without a partner (unmarried);
therefore whether in a bond (marriage) or in the unmarried state you bear the entire responsibility for every
and each thing that you do; and in the bond (marriage) it is both the woman and the man who bear complete
responsibility for the clan (family) and therefore the descendants as well as for the hearth (household) and pos-
sessions and wealth; and if everything is managed and created jointly then all parties have an equal right to all
possessions and wealth, but if the bond breaks apart then everything that has been created jointly shall fall
due in equal measure to the man and woman; if the man or woman brings his or her own possessions into
the bond (marriage) then every possession and the wealth shall be due commensurately (accordingly) to the
one who brought it with them as their own (goods brought with them), which shall also apply if the bond
(marriage) is dissolved; neither man nor woman shall be preferred in the responsibility and management of the
clan (family) and the descendants and the hearth (household) because the management and welfare of these
are in the responsibility of both, but it shall be that the more discerning party, man or woman, bears a heavier
responsibility than the less discerning party; and therefore it is rightful that both the man and the woman are
obedient to one another in responsibility and keep their joint secrets of the bond (marriage) in public and there-
fore do not talk with interveners (third parties) about it so that the confidentiality of the unity of the bonded
companions (marriage partners) may be retained; if however one bonded companion (married partner) behaves
with intractability or vice or pathological craving so that the bond (marriage) and the management of the clan
(family) and provision for the descendants and welfare of the hearth (household) suffer harm, then the juris-
diction shall make a choice (decision) about the reprimand so that the intractability, vice or pathological crav-
ing may be counteracted and resolved; and if the intractable party obeys and demonstrates throughout one
year that the evil has been rectified, then no further measures shall be sought against him or her; if, however,
it becomes apparent after one year that the choice (decision) and the reprimand are being contravened then
the jurisdiction shall impose a punishment involving confinement to a place of fulfilment of guidelines (seclu-
ded regions or islands) for a time of two years for coming to terms (healing/recovery); if the fulfilment of mea-
sures (punishment by separation from society for a certain time) does not yield any benefit (success) then the
bond (marriage) shall be dissolved so that the harm and destruction of the clan (family) does not continue to
grow.
  59) And if a rift comes about between a man and a woman in a bond (marriage) then one arbitrator each from
the man’s side and the woman’s side shall be appointed to bring about a reconciliation between the man and
the woman so that peace and consonance (harmony) may reign amongst them; if however no reconciliation
comes about and the rift continues then it leads to destruction (breakdown) of the bond (marriage) so that this
shall be dissolved one year after the desire for reconciliation, and one letter of separation each shall be given
to the man and to the woman.
  60) Direct yourselves in all things according to true equitableness (fairness) and do not set unright at its side, as
you shall also do in the wise that you show kindheartedness and mildness to your parents and their parents
(your grandparents), as well as to for your brothers and sisters and relations, to your immediate neighbours
and those who are strangers to you, therefore you shall also act in the same wise towards the poor and needy
as well as the companions at your side and travellers, all of whom shall have the same rights as people of your
kind (human beings) and to whom you shall grant these rights because it is your duty towards people of your
kind (fellow human beings); do not be of pride and do not be show-offs (loudmouths/boasters/big-mouths)
towards people of your kind (fellow human beings), since truly you make yourselves unpopular and unthink -
able (impossible) as you also prevent yourselves from being deemed as worthy (taken seriously).
  61) Those amongst you who are stingy and mislead people of your kind (fellow human beings) into stinginess and,
in stinginess, keep secret what has been granted to you and what you have created and the wealth you have
achieved, so that you do not have to give to the poor and needy that part of which is their due from you, then
you are also practising deceit with the share (tax) that you owe to the people (state) for its upkeep and for its
efforts, in which case you shall be brought to punishment by the jurisdiction.
  62) And those amongst you who share out (donate) some of your goods and chattels and wealth so that you are
seen and praised by the people, you shall know that you are only being guided (led) by evil and voracity for
renown, and that falseness (deviousness) is your companion and your only reward will be disaster.
  63) Consider what will happen to all of you if you have fallen prey to stinginess and do not present (donate) some
of your possessions and wealth to the poor and needy; truly, you will find neither gladness nor love nor peace
in yourselves, neither happiness nor consonance (harmony) and no true freedom, because you are captives of
yourselves and of your stinginess.
64) Truly, not one iota of unright happens to any of you if you have fallen prey to unrighteousness (conscienceless-
 ness) and to stinginess, and the fire of admonishment (conscience) and dissonance (disharmony) as well as the
 fire of unlove and unfreedom and unpeace burns in you; therefore be remorseful and turn yourselves away
 from all your evil and from unright and do good deeds which you ought to redouble continuously so that the
 good deeds multiply and are sufficient to grant you a great reward.
65) And consider that it will go badly with you and that you will fall into great shame if you stand before the people
 and witnesses are brought forth who call you as witnesses against yourselves and your unrightful doings and
 against your unrighteousness (consciencelessness) so that you fall into disparagement (contemptibility/un-
 worthiness) before the people.
66) Therefore the disparagement (contemptibility) of the people will, one fine day, also strike those amongst you
 who persist in the unknowledge about the truth-teaching and who rise up against the true prophets, becau-
 se you grant your godliness (belief) to the priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of gods and tin gods, and
 slander (calumniate) and persecute the prophets because of their teaching and strive to kill them; and truly,
 those of you who do such things will wish on that day when knowledge of the truth ripens in you and over-
 whelms you, that the earth would be covered over you because then the deepest things of the truth of the
 primal power (Creation) will befall you and you will wish to sink into the soil in your shame.
67) However, do not approach the truth out of evil striving if you are not of right sense (if the truth is denied), but
 do this only if you know what you want in a righteous (conscientious) wise and in equitableness (fairness) in
 order to learn about the truth; therefore you shall keep yourselves distant from the truth if you want to slan-
 der (calumniate) it, just as you shall only then turn to it if you have a righteous (conscientious) sense, because
 truly with an unrighteous (conscienceless) sense the truth will remain closed to you.
68) And if you are travelling, man or woman, then do the same as in your own house, involving washing or bathing
 daily to maintain your purity (hygiene) as often as the occasion (conditions) require; and this also applies to sick
 people and those working under dirty conditions, and also when you come from the privy (toilet); and it is also
 recommended for you to clean yourselves by washing or with a bath after you have lain with one another (had
 sexual intercourse); and man and woman remove your hair from your private parts in order to maintain your
 purity (hygiene) and health and so that no vermin may lodge themselves there; however, do not defile (circum-
 cise) your sexual organ, so that it may be left in the status of appearance (nature) for the sake of complete-
 ness, and it may only be modified (circumcised) for reasons of health (medical/surgical measures); and if you
 do not find any water for you to clean yourselves with then obtain (take) suitable cloths (towels) and use them
 to clean yourselves.
69) Do not listen to the false prophets, neither to the priests and servants (hands/helpers) of gods and tin gods
 who bring you false teachings and obligations (religions/beliefs) and false modes (forms) of attitude (behaviour)
 as well as false and delusional customs (rituals) so that you may gain (acquire) it in erroneous assumption and
 stray from the way of the true truth-teaching, and thus from the teaching of the wellspring of the life
 (Creation) in order to burn in the fire of the untruth and erroneous assumption.
70) Do not be those amongst you who twist (falsify) the words of the truth from their correct positions (in their
 true form), because truly you hear the words of the truth but you do not follow them; you hear the words of
 the truth but do not really listen to them, and with your tongues (words and lies) you conceal what is really in
 you in terms of untruth and unknowledge, and you attempt to slander (calumniate) the truth-teaching of the
 prophets and the truth of the Creation; and truly it would be better and more upright for you to turn to the
 truth and listen to it so that you do not curse yourselves because of your unknowledge and your slander
 (calumny).
71) Those of you who hear the teaching of the truth brought to you through the teaching of the prophets, strive
 to comprehend (understand) the teaching and to fulfil it as already happened before you with those who turned
 to the truth of the primal power (Creation); therefore do not destroy the teaching of the truth, the teaching
 of the spirit, the teaching of the life and do not persecute the true prophets and do not accuse (blame) them
 of lying, deception or unhonesty so that you do not deceive yourselves and curse yourselves.
72) Truly, it cannot be of any good to you if you remain far from the truth-teaching and if you place gods and tin
 gods as well as priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods at the side of the wellspring of wis-
 dom (Creation); and whoever places gods and tin gods next to the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) has truth-
 fully devised a disaster in themselves.
73) Consider those who think they are pure and truthful in the truth because they are trapped in the belief in a god or tin god fabulated (invented) by people of your kind (human beings) and lend their ear to the priests
and servants of gods and servants of tin gods, and therefore miss the way of the truth only to live in hatred
and jealousy, in desires (vices/wantonness/pathological cravings/urges) and in the pathological craving for
revenge as well as in the delusion of retaliation and of punishment, and only to wage battles (wars), to kill in many different wises and to do everything evil and bad, believing it to be rightful, such as the false prophets and priests of your belief and your obligation (religion) teach you, although it is evil unright and against the truth and against the equitableness (fairness) of the life; however, the truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations do not know one iota of unright under which you and the people of your kind (fellow human beings) shall suffer.
74) Look at them so that you recognise them evidently as false prophets and as priests and other servants
 (hands/helpers) for fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, and do not lend your ear to those who invent lies
 and slanders (calumnies) against the truth of the primal power (Creation) and against the true prophets and
 against the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
75) Know about all those and recognise them who receive the truth-teaching but who nevertheless believe in bad
 untruths and who follow the malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth such as false prophets, false
 teachers and priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods who lie to you and claim that you
 would be better guided as believers in their false teachings, but truly they slander (calumniate) the truth so that
 you are led into delusion by them and will not find any truthly helpers amongst them.
76) Those who lead you into confusion with false teachings, they do not have any share in the real truth of the
 primal power (Creation), and therefore they are not even able to give (explain) as much as the groove in a grain
 of corn of the truth and of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation).
77) Truly, only the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and therefore the
 unknowing ones in the truth are envious of those amongst you because of the grace (kindheartedness) that
 you gain from learning about and following the truth; indeed, it would be quite possible for them to gain grace
 (kindheartedness) in the same wise because the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
 of the life and all the wisdom derived from it is given to them in the same wise as to you, and if they followed
 the truth then they would win in themselves a mighty realm of knowledge and wisdom, love and truth as well
 as of peace and freedom and consonance (harmony).
78) Some amongst you know about the real truth of the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) and you follow its way
 of nobleness (virtue) and of righteousness (conscientiousness), but many amongst you turn away from it and
 so the shadow world blazes in you as a flaming fire.
79) At all times when you show contempt for and slander the truth of the wellspring of the life (Creation) and do
 not turn yourselves towards it, as it has been brought by the teaching of true prophets, for all this time you
 are refusing your happiness and your wellbeing, your freedom and consonance (harmony) and your peace in
 yourselves; and as often as you burn your inner skin (inner nature) on the fire of unknowledge, just as often
 do you taste to the full your punishment that you have brought down on yourselves.
80) If you turn to the truth of the primal wellspring (Creation) and do good deeds according to its laws and recom- mendations, then you form in yourselves blossoming gardens through which the streams of love and freedom,
peace and harmony flow, wherein you will remain and enjoy yourselves in the benevolence of your existence;
and in your status of your wellbeing, you will have pure and honest companions because you grant them
access to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and to knowledge and
wisdom as well as access to the true and beneficial love and to the freedom in themselves, so they also may
have peace and harmony in themselves and you meet one another in solidarity and confidentiality (friendship).
81) Truly, the recommendations state that you shall only give your confidential matters of any kind to those who
 are worthy of them, so that they may be dealt with rightfully and held in esteem and passed on in dignity, be
 it a substantive case, a case of confidential advice, grief, love, care, discord or a thing of the authorities or juridi-
 cal punishment or judgement.
82) And if you have to decide (determine) between people of your kind (human beings) in any things, then only
 decide according to equitableness (fairness) and according to the circumstances, but not however according
 to belief (assumptions) and apparent evidence (indications), so that you do not accuse unfairly but only reach
 a judgement in rightness according to the laws of the primal power (Creation) and prescribe a punishment in
 a commensurate wise; and the hardest punishment in equitableness (fairness) shall be for a woman to be sepa-
 rated from men or a man separated from women (exclusion from the other sex) as fulfilment of guidelines in
 a place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded place/isolated island) where even the fallible ones shall be given
 everything necessary to learn about the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and to fol-
 low them, as they shall also be given everything so that they can obtain their provision (sustenance) and every-
 thing necessary through the power of their own hands.
83) And if fallible ones have to be integrated into a fulfilment of guidelines, then the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) recommend that each punishment shall be given in a helpful and kindhearted
wise, but never in a wise of bodily (physical) chastisement (violation) or cruelty (torture), just as not by harming
the psyche or killing in any wise because such a deed of any kind is entirely against the laws and recommen-
dations of the primal power (Creation) which has arranged (determined) in any case that all life shall be shielded (protected) and untouchable.
84) All of you who turn to the teaching of the prophets, the teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching
 of the life which is the teaching of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of the
 life (Creation), do not listen to your priests of gods and tin gods or any other servants of gods and servants of
 tin gods, but turn yourselves to the true teaching of the prophets and follow the laws and recommendations
 of the primal wellspring of the life (Creation); and be willing only to the righteous ones (conscientious ones)
 who have the Gewalt of direction (Gewalt of authority) over you, but ignore those who are unrighteous ones
 (conscienceless ones); and the same applies to the righteousness (conscientiousness) and unrighteousness
 (consciencelessness) of the authority, jurisdiction, demagogues, lords, Gewalt-rulers, rulers, provosts and
 masters.
85) And if there is disunity amongst you, then present your concerns to a wise advisor, to truly wise ones or to a
 true prophet, but not however to false advisors, false wise ones and not to false prophets and priests or other
 servants of gods and servants of tin gods, as well as also not to people of your kind (human beings) who pur-
 port to be envoys or authorised ones (substitutes) of gods and tin gods or who otherwise raise themselves up
 above themselves and above you as brilliant ones (sublime ones) or as endless ones (divine ones).
86) Do not bow down before what is presented to you as beliefs (assumptions) in gods and tin gods, but know
 about the truth-teaching from the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) which is
 revealed to you through the teaching of the prophets; and do not search for your rights from the indignant
 ones who are against the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because you
 are recommended not to listen to those who advocate evil and want to lead you into confusion, far away from
 the right way.
87) And if the ones who are indignant against the truth-teaching tell you that you shall come to them and to their
 false teaching of their false envoys (prophets) and priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods, then
 show your unwillingness (aversion) against the hypocrites of the falseness (deviousness) and turn yourselves
 away from them.
88) Think it over and protect yourselves when the indignant ones against the truth-teaching and the truth come
 separately (alone) and quickly to you and look for help from you with false discourses, when they are struck
 by calamity, because then they will swear that they only wanted the good and the conciliatory, although this
 will only be a lie because they will fall back into their untruthly deeds once your help has brought them bene-
 fit (success).
89) Heed the true attitude (mentality) of those who set themselves as indignant ones against the truth and look
 for help from you in order to deceive you; yet do not turn away from them without giving help, but remind
 them of the truth and speak a strong word to them about their state of their false thinking and their slander
 (calumny) so that they may consider this and search for the way to the truth.
90) And consider that the true prophets do not come to you so that you obey them and their teaching, because
 truly they are only admonishers (teachers and advisers) for you to strive for the truth of the primal power
 (Creation) and find the way to it, so that you fulfil the laws and recommendations of the primal power
 (Creation) and have a good life; the teaching of the true prophets is not a coercion and not a subservient
 subjection (obligation to obey), but it is given so that every one of you may illuminate yourselves (explain it) in
 voluntary considering and find the truth in order to turn towards it.
91) And those amongst you who have not yet found your way to the teaching of the truth, to the teaching of the
 wellspring of all life (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, therefore who are still living in unknowl-
 edge of the truth and in lapses, slanders, blame and unvirtues, you could find lenience (forgiveness) in the teach-
 ing of the truth, and therefore you would not dare to slander (calumniate) the true prophets, to persecute them
 and threaten them with death instead of begging (asking for) them for forgiveness for your disgraceful doings,
 so that you truly find sympathy (feelings for others) and benevolence from them.
92) Those amongst you, however, who are believers in gods and tin gods because you lend your ear to the priests
 of gods and priests of tin gods and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods, you cannot become ones
 who have knowledge of the truth until you place yourselves as judges over your own selves and above every-
 thing that is contentious in you so that you may turn to the truth-teaching of the prophets and no longer have
 any doubts in yourselves about your decision to connect yourselves to the truth and to join this acquiescence
 (forbearance).
93) And it is not commanded to you by the laws and recommendations of the Creation that you shall kill people of your kind (fellow human beings), but a certain number amongst you leave your dwellings in order to kill
and to break the law of the Creation: «You shall not kill in Ausartung»; truly, you are only allowed to kill when
the necessity to protect your own life or the lives of your next ones requires it, but only a few amongst you
abide by this, because through the false teachings of false prophets and false priests and other servants
(hands/helpers) of fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, killing is more likely for many than the protection
of the life; if you as descendants of your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) who received the truth-teaching in olden days before you, would do what you are requested to do even today by the true prophets and by their teaching of the laws and recommendations of the Creation, then it would truly be better for you and you would be led to greater strength (a life more amenable to the laws of the Creation) through yourselves and through your authority.
94) And truly, if you followed the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all wisdom (Creation),
 then you would receive a magnificent reward as thanks, and your life would be an honourable pleasure if you
 would only direct (guide) yourselves onto the right way of the truth.
95) Anyone who is diligent (obedient) to the teaching of the prophets, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of
 the spirit, the teaching of the life will always be amongst those who gain grace (kindheartedness) and love in
 life and in whom there will be freedom and peace and therefore also consonance (harmony); and whoever fol-
 lows the truth will comprehend (understand) the truthfulness of the true prophets, of the fair ones (responsi-
 ble ones) and will see their signs (marvels) and enjoy their great wisdom, truly they will also have the truthly
 prophets as their best companions and teachers, because true kindheartedness emanates from them.
96) And those amongst you who know about the truth always take precautions so that you are not alone amongst
 the mass of the ones who have no knowledge of the truth, but that there are always several of you, in droves
 or many together, so that you are not annoyed (harassed/victimised) by the believers in gods and tin gods, so
 that you may be connected to the truth in prudence and without peevishness; consider that merely dwelling
 (living) as ones who are knowing of the truth in a minority amongst a large mass of people brings disaster
 because the superiority of the number of ones who are unknowing of the truth in the mass of the people is
 always boundless in its intemperateness (excessiveness) against any small number (minority); therefore as ones
 who are knowing of the truth you shall not stand out imprudently amongst the collection (mass) of the people
 who are unknowing of the truth, but only raise up the word of the truth and teach the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life where it is asked for and desired so that you do not commit
 misfeasance (proselytising) and do not do the same as the obligations (sects and religions) who look for and
 lure (bewitch/ ensnare) believers with lying, deceit and delusion in order to exploit them, beat them into sub-
 servience and rob them off their own will and their own responsibility.
97) There are some amongst you who grow weak (fainthearted) and lag behind (deteriorate in misery) if unfortu-
 ne befalls you, but as you learn through the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life which is explained to you by the teaching of the prophets, then you will be full of activity (energy) and
 full of power and will be strong so that you know how to overcome even the worst disaster without breaking
 down.
98) And there are some amongst you who are over-courageous if good fortune befalls you and you want to have
 more in the irrationality of your small thinking and in your greed; and if you gain profit from a deal with one
 of your kind (fellow human being) then you are robbing (plundering) that human being for your own benefit
 (advantage), therefore you cannot achieve any friendship between that human being and yourselves; and truly,
 if you would recognise (see) those in friendship with whom you are conducting a deal then you would achieve
 great successes.
99) And those amongst you who are connected to the real truth and therefore to the teaching of the prophets,
 only ever allow fair ones (responsible ones) and ones who are knowing of the truth to fight with the weapons
 of honesty, equitableness (fairness), virtues, esteem and deference for the truth of the primal power (Creation)
 and its laws and recommendations; and never be foolish enough to throw away your mortal (earthly) life
 because of the truth, because it is better to be quiet and silent and to keep the truth only in you so that your
 adversaries do not bring you affliction and do not endanger your life; therefore because you fight only in your-
 selves alone for the truth of the primal power (Creation) and thus for the truth-teaching, a magnificent reward
 will be granted to you in that true love and peace will prosper in you, and freedom and consonance (harmony)
 will bring you wellbeing in your inner nature.
100) But what is the matter with those amongst you who do not fight for the cause of the truth, nor for the teach -
 ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and therefore not for the teaching of the
 wellspring of all wisdom (Creation) which is given by its laws and recommendations, and what is the matter
 with you who do not fight for the interests of the weak and the poor and needy, the women, the men and
 the children who would like to be led out from their hardship and their misery and away from their oppressors
 (tyrants/despots)?; truly, you are neither protectors nor helpers for them because you leave them to waste away
 in their misery, but you will reap a disastrous reward for this.
101) Those amongst you who know about the truth of the wellspring of all origin (Creation), you are fighting with
 the weapons of the truth, love and consonance (harmony) and in peace and freedom for its cause; you, how-
 ever, who are unknowing ones and unfair ones (irresponsible ones), you are fighting with the sword, and there-
 fore with all weapons of death for the cause of evil, for the lie and untruth; but you are fighting a hopeless
 fight as the friends of evil, whose generalship is death and ruin and destruction.
 102) Curb your hands holding the sword that you are wielding against the truth in your battle against it, because
  you are afraid of it and your fear grows ever greater; truly, the laws and recommendations of the primal well-
  spring (Creation) do not decree any fight with Gewalt of weapons in order to murder, rather they demand love
  and peace so that you may live in freedom and harmony.
 103) Defer (terminate) your fight against the truth, because those amongst you who fight against the truth with the
  sword and other weapons of death, truly your advantage (benefit) will only be slight and of short duration,
  therefore it is better for you to turn to the truth and its teaching in deference so that you no longer spread a
  single iota of unright.
 104) Be certain (knowing) that wherever you may be that you cannot escape death because it will befall you even
  though you may be inside the most strongly built tower, therefore heed death wherever you may be so that it
  seizes you in right deeds rather than unright deeds; and think at all times about death and learn that it is un-
  avoidable and that you are bound to it, as is everything that lives and crawls and flies, so that you are not
  frightened when you stand before it and have to leave your life.
 105) And consider, if goodness that makes you glad happens to you in life or dying, that, if it does not come from
  outside, it comes from your life-conduct, as it also is if bad befalls you in life or dying and you are afraid; truly,
  everyone of your kind (human beings) and therefore all people will always get what they merit because of what
  they have earned, whether it be good or evil, if only you would understand this.
 106) Whatever goodness you get, all of it comes from your good mentality, just as everything terrible that strikes
  you comes from your own mentality; truly, you are yourselves your own prophets as you allot (determine) your-
  selves in all things of your life and announce what redounds to your benefit or harm, and for this you are your
  own witnesses.
 107) If you direct yourselves in free determination (decision), willingly and knowingly (consciously), towards the
  teaching of the prophets, their teaching of the truth, their teaching of the spirit, their teaching of the life, then
  you are indeed guiding yourselves towards the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal well-
  spring of all existence (Creation); but if you all direct yourselves in free determination (decision), willingly and
  knowingly (consciously) away from the truth-teaching, then you make yourselves into guardians of the untruth
  and evil.
 108) Coerced obedience is not the guideline (leading thought) of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
  the teaching of the life, rather it is freedom of will in order to fathom out the truth in the freedom of will and
  to understand it so that it may be accepted in the freedom of will and that life may be led and managed with
  it.
 109) Be certain (knowing) that those amongst you who regard the guideline (leading thought) of the teaching of
  the truth as coercion, you are feigning and are swearing falsely by day that you are connected to the truth and
  its teaching, but at night you turn away from it and strive to slander (calumniate) and destroy it, but your
  reward for this will be full of disaster; it is better for you not to concoct attacks against the truth-teaching, but
  to be honestly connected to it and build upon it so that you may be bearers of the trust for the truth.
 110) Truly, do you not want to ponder on the teaching of the prophets and on the laws and recommendations of
  the primal power (Creation), but do you want to continue to court with the untruth despite finding innumer-
  able contradictions in it?; however, be certain (knowing) that the contradictions in the untruth always change
  to your disadvantage and kindle a fire in your inner nature and in your admonishment (conscience) on which
  you burn yourselves.
 111) If a rumour reaches you, whether it contains peace or unpeace, joy or affliction, goodness or evil or friendli-
  ness or unfriendliness, then do not spread it, because rumours bring about enmity and hatred, and bring mis-
  ery on those who are defamed; and if you bring rumours before the jurisdiction or before others who have the
  Gewalt of command and who understand how to bring out the truth, then be aware (on your guard) that no
  blame falls on you yourselves, because you are propagating slander (calumny); if you follow (spread) rumours
  then you will be disadvantaged in all cases because you will not receive any kindheartedness, love, lenience
  (forgiveness) from those whom your rumours have been about, so that they will hound you in hatred as if evil
  itself were on your heels.
 112) And if defamatory rumours originate about the truth and the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) then confront them and fight with peaceful means for the cause of the truth so
 that the rumours cease and all people of your kind (human beings) experience the truth; only in a peaceful
 wise should you counter the rumours against the truth and the truth-teaching, in order to rein in (moderate)
 the deeds of the rumour mongers and slanderers (calumniators) of the truth and its teaching and the teaching
 of the true prophets; do not impose any penal Gewalt on the adversaries and the ones who have no knowl-
 ege of the truth and the truth-teaching, but consider that the truth is stronger than any lie as is taught by a
  true-saying (aphorism/apophthegm/epigram) that the truth always comes to the light of the sun sooner or
  later.
 113) Whoever intercedes in a fair (responsible) wise for the truth and for the teaching of the true prophets, for their
  teaching of the truth, their teaching of the spirit, their teaching of the life and therefore for the teaching of
  the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all presence (existence), those will get a part for
  their good existence, in true love and freedom in their inner nature, as well as peace and consonance (har-
  mony); however whoever intercedes for an unfair (irresponsible) cause, those will get a part in the unfair (irre-
  sponsible) cause because the foreordination from a cause and the effect (effect = cause and effect) is mighty
  over all things.
 114) And if you are greeted with a wish of happiness (felicitations), then reply with an even more beautiful greet-
  ing, or if you do not like it then at least give a simple and decent greeting in return in order to pay account in
  fullness (sufficiency).
 115) The real truth of the wellspring of all life (Creation) and of its laws and recommendations renders all lies and
  slanders (calumnies) worthless, and it is certain that only congregating around it is of excellence and there is
  no doubt about this; whoever, on the other hand, congregates before evil and kneels down in belief (assump-
  tions) in gods and tin gods or before people of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up (make them-
  selves great and important) and extol (identify) themselves as representatives (envoys) and authorised ones
  (substitutes) of gods and tin gods, they are not truthful (not upright/they are far from the truth) in their knowl-
  edge and in their words.
 116) Do not let it happen that you are split into two parties against those who are unknowing of the truth, against
  the hypocrites and unfair ones (irresponsible ones) so that you will not cast yourselves out for what the un-
  knowing ones and hypocrites and the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) have done and continue to do and
  thereby fall into ruin; and truly, whoever takes the way of ruin will not find a way to the true love, freedom
  and consonance (harmony) or to the peace in their own inner nature.
 117) The ones who are unknowing of the truth, the hypocrites and unfair ones (irresponsible ones), the unrighteous
  ones (conscienceless ones) and the ones without virtue are striving for you to be the same as them, because
  they have fallen prey to inequity (unfairness) and do not want to tolerate you speaking to their admonishment
  (conscience).
 118) Do not take ones unknowing of the truth, unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), hypocrites or unfair ones
  (irresponsible ones) and ones without virtue to be your true friends if they want to make you the same as them:
  however, take them as friends if they want to set out on the way leading to the truth and to the teaching of
  the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation); but if they turn away from the way
  leading to the truth once again and do not realise it, then do not bring any affliction down upon them or kill
  (murder) them, but instead be helpful to them wherever you find them so that they recognise and understand
  the truth-teaching and the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation), and return
  and become friends and helpers of the truth.
 119) Do not fight with the Gewalt of weapons against another people that is connected to you in a bond, and also
  do not fight with the Gewalt of weapons against a people that is strange to you and is not connected to you
  through a bond, because any fight with weapons involving killing (murder) is unrightful and against the laws
  of love as they are given by the Creation; therefore you shall be terrified from fighting with the weapons of
  death and never fight against your own or against another people; and if you have to fight against your own
  or another people, then it shall only be done with words that you use carefully (rationally) and with true dis-
  cernment (intellect) so that peace and freedom may come about, but not however battle (war) and unpeace
  or the spilling of blood or bloody deeds (murder) and other killing.
 120) If other people of your kind (human beings) or peoples gain might over you then defend yourselves with all
  your fair (appropriate) means, but never reach for weapons in order to kill, so you shall fight against your adver-
  saries with gewaltsamer Gewaltlosigkeit so that all of those who are against you will stay away from you and
  your people; consider that the truth and righteousness (conscientiousness), peace and love as well as freedom
  do not permit any kind of attack or any kind of fight with deadly weapons.
 121) Truly, you will find people of your kind (human beings) who wish to be protected from you and protected from
  their own people, and they want to live in peace with you or with their own people, but pay heed to them in
  watchfulness because once they are misled again into hostility, they will plunge themselves headfirst into it
  once again; therefore, if they do not stay away from you and do not offer you either peace or restrain their
  hands in order not to be active using Gewalt and to offer peace, then do not capture them and do not kill
  (murder) them but strive to offer them the hand of peace and to teach them the truth; but if they continue
  their hostility, then repel them from yourselves wherever you find them so that they take other ways and move
  away.
  122) No person of your kind (human being) is entitled to kill another person of your kind (human being) except if it
is done in extreme defence; and therefore everyone take care that he or she does not kill someone of your kind
(human being) by accident (unattentiveness) or out of carelessness; if however someone of your kind (human
being) is killed (murdered) by accident (unattentiveness) or carelessness, man, woman or child, then the un-
wanted fallibility shall be punished for a time of three years at a place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded place/
isolated island), after which assistance and help shall be provided to the bereaved family of the one who was
killed (murdered), in the form of manual work and with silver and gold (money/financial means) according to
the earlier responsibility of the one who was killed (murdered); but if the bereaved family waives the assistance
and help out of mildness then this shall be rightful; if however a person of your kind (human being) is deliberate-
ly (intentionally) killed (murdered), for whatever reason, then the manslayer (murderer), man or woman, shall be
subject to punishment by seclusion of the sexes (exclusion from society with separation of woman from man
and man from woman) in a place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded place/isolated island), with the time of
punishment set at thirty years, after which the jurisdiction shall establish whether the fallible one, man or woman,
has undergone a change and turned to the truth and to the laws; and if the change has come about, then free-
dom shall be granted again, after which assistance and help shall be provided to the bereaved family of the one
who was killed (murdered), in the form of manual work and with silver and gold (money/financial means) ac-
cording to the earlier responsibility of the one who was killed (murdered); but if the bereaved family waives the
assistance and help out of mildness then this shall be rightful; if, however, children are guilty of killing with malice
of forethought (with intent) then they shall be subject to a punishment at a place of fulfilment of guidelines
(secluded place/isolated island) for a period of time appropriate (according) to their age, which shall be deter-
mined by the severity of the deed; and children are regarded as all who have not yet grown out of youth (not
yet adult = differs from state to state); manslayers (murderers) of any kind who deliberately (intentionally) kill
people of your kind (human beings) shall be subject to the same punishment, without differentiation, of thirty
years; if however a man, a woman or a child kills (murders) whilst their inner world (consciousness) and their
psyche is confused or sick then they shall not be sent for punishment but to a place for healing their confusion
or illness so that they may once again live up to their wellbeing and life-power, as well as to the clarity of their
inner world (consciousness) and their psyche, following which they shall once again enjoy their freedom; if how-
ever healing the confusion or illness proves impossible then they shall be made to stay in a place (corresponding
clinic, psychiatric hospital, etc.) for the duration of their life, for the good of their health and their safety; how-
ever, it is not given that those fallible of killing (murdering) of any kind or other nefarious ones and villains or
law breakers shall be harmed in their body and limbs (extremities) or in their psyche or their inner world (con-
sciousness) or chastised by cruelty (torture) or coerced into a confession (admission); truly, no person of your kind
(human being) is entitled to harm another person of your kind (human being), to commit cruelty (torture) on
him or her or to kill him or her; whoever nevertheless deliberately (intentionally) kills (murders), their reward shall
be the fire of destruction and misery which burns unceasingly in the admonishment (conscience).
  123) When you associate with people of your kind (fellow human beings), then only go out (go to them) if you take
the way on which you have first undertaken pertinent (thorough/proper) investigations in order to discover
who is the next one to whom you are turning; therefore, first consider which words you want to choose when
you meet the human being so that you do not say to everyone who offers you a peaceful greeting that this
human being is an unknowing one in the truth.
  124) Truly, you are striving for the goods of earthly life, but in the teaching of the laws and recommendations of
the wellspring of the life (Creation) given by the teaching of the prophets is goodness in fullness; once you
were without the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, but the true prophets
poured the truth-teaching over you in kindheartedness so that you shall be knowing in their richness; but you
have forgotten all of it because you did not want to heed the teaching, therefore it befits you today that you
undertake considerable (thorough/correct) research (giving attention) so that you will once again be knowing
in the teaching of the prophets and follow it.
  125) Those amongst you who sit still (remain inactive) although you are not infirm, and those amongst you who put
chattels and silver and gold to use for the cause of the truth and do not conduct evil strife for the sake of the
truth-teaching, you are different in your doing, because those who sit still (remain inactive) are indulging in
unknowledge and terrible things whereas you who fight well and peacefully for the truth-teaching, you are
bringing down tribulation on yourselves from the unknowing ones and the indolent ones, but in yourselves
you are creating love and peace as well as consonance (harmony) and freedom.
  126) Consider that the truth-teaching does not bestow any levels of excellence in the knowledge and following of
it, neither benevolence nor particular forgiveness, because truly if you want to be benevolent and forgiving
then you must create that in yourselves, as well as the levelless excellence which is common to anyone who
strives for the knowledge of the truth-teaching.
  127) Truly, those amongst you who remain far from the truth, you will be carried off by everything evil and by all disasters so you miss the goodness and the values of the life, because you are not striving for the truth of the
  primal power (Creation) and its laws and recommendations as you treat yourselves as weak ones of the life;
  and for you weak ones, the truth is so far away that you cannot make your way to it unless you change your attitude (mentality) and place all false teachings of fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods behind your back so that you strive to reach the real truth in front of them; if, however you do not follow the way of the truth of the primal power (Creation) and continue to persist in unknowledge of the truth then you will continue to cre- ate the destiny in yourselves that your inner nature is a place where the shadow world (hell) resides, the fire of which will consume you.
  128) And many amongst you have fallen prey to weakness, man and woman, as well as children, all of whom you
teach weakness from the cradle onwards through the false teachings of the false prophets and priests and
other servants (hands/helpers) of fabulated (invented/thought up) gods and tin gods so they cannot take a
decision and find a way to recognise the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal power
(Creation), and to understand and follow them.
  129) Truly, all your fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods as well as your false prophets and your priests and ser-
vants of gods and servants of tin gods are unable to eliminate (eradicate) your faults that you commit, and
therefore they cannot redeem your culpability which you bring down on yourselves, because the redeemers of
your culpability and the eliminators (eradicators) of your faults are you yourselves.
  130) And anyone who moves away (leaves) their dwelling or their country in order to stand up for (carry further) the cause of the truth in freedom and consonance (harmony) without cajoling (proselytising) and without the
  weapons of Gewalt and of death, but only by using the word and only letting those hear it who ask about it,
  you will find sufficient places of refuge and of fullness on Earth amongst those who are thirsting for the truth.
  131) However, whoever leaves the house or their country in order to stand up for (carry further) the teaching of the
truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, shall walk on the same way of modesty as the true
prophets and in doing so, make sure that he or she is not done to death by those who persecute and slander
(calumniate) him or her and who are out for his or her blood.
  132) And if you pass through the land, and do not explain (teach) yourselves the teaching of the laws and recom-
mendations of the wellspring of all existence (Creation) or curtail the explanation (teaching) then it shall be
rightful for you if you nonetheless hold to and follow the laws and recommendations.
  133) If you are afraid that ones who are unknowing of the truth may assail you, because they stand up as open ene-
mies against the truth and against you, then you shall not acquire (buy/procure) weapons of Gewalt and of
death in order to fight against them whenever possible, instead try to find a peaceful way of avoiding them or
using words of clarity (rationality) to move them to insight (rationality) and to peace.
  134) And if you as ones who have knowledge of the truth find yourselves amongst ones who have no knowledge
of the truth and have to undertake a deed (work) or whatever else with them, then allow them to stand with
you (undertake it together/cooperate) but take care that they do not raise up (make threats with) weapons of
villainy (disingenuousness) against you and against the truth-teaching in order to cast you down (coerce you)
into their belief (assumptions); and if they attempt to carry out your casting down then put them behind you
(turn your back on them and go away), but you shall be on your guard (watchful) because their weapons of
villainy (disingenuousness) can strike you again and again at any time in order to demoralise you.
  135) The enemies of the truth and the enemies of the teaching of the prophets and therefore also the enemies of
the truth-teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all things and all life
(Creation), by which it is meant the confused people and its false prophets and priests and servants of gods
and servants of tin gods who make their adorers into like-minded ones and believers, they like it if you do not
provide yourselves with weapons of precaution and of clear-sightedness (rationality) and leave aside all your
watchfulness so that they can suddenly assail you (lead you into confusion), take away (pervert) your knowl-
edge of the truth; against the enemies of the truth it is permitted and rightful for you to take their weapons
of villainy (disingenuousness) away from them through true discernment (rationality) by striking back (counter-
ing) their false words and teachings so that they wash themselves clean and heal themselves of their illness
(false belief) and lay down their weapons of villainy (disingenuousness) and slander (calumny) against the truth-
teaching; but at all times be on your guard (watchful) because the intrigues (guilefulness) of those who declaim
against the truth and the teaching of the truth and the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the
Creation are manifold in their attempts to delude the ones who have knowledge of the truth and to turn them
away from their insight into the truth-teaching so that they shall fall prey to the traps of the godliness (religion)
and of the belief (assumptions), as well as of the priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because
truly they have disparaging (villainous/despicable) methods in order to achieve their intentions (purposes).
  136) And if you are learning the teaching of the prophets, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and therefore the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the
  beauty (Creation), then remember with a prayer (invocation/edification) also your inner world (consciousness)
  in contemplation (meditation) at the same time so that you align yourselves towards true love and consonance
  (harmony) as well as to peace and freedom in your inner nature; and do this when seated or standing, when walking or when you are on your back, on your belly or lying on your side; and when you have finished learn- ing, then make prayers (invocations/edification) to your inner world (consciousness) according to your need, so that its unfolding (evolution) may progress and everything may go well with you in all things; and carry out your prayers (invocations/edification) according to your needs, since you do not have to select specific hours for this, as you shall do for special contemplations (meditations) or initiations.
  137) And never cease to search for the depths of the truth and the laws and recommendations of the primal well-
spring of all truth (Creation), because if you do not do so then you will suffer and your inner world (conscious-
ness) will remain unfruitful (remain fallow); and as you suffer so also people of your kind (fellow human beings)
with whom you have dealings will also suffer; however, do not hope for things of cognition which you cannot
hope for (shall not experience), because if you were to gain cognitions that are beyond your discernment
(understanding) then you would not become knowing (conscious) and wise, but would fall prey to confusions
(consciousness-confusion/sense-confusions).
  138) The true prophets have brought the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life
to you, the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all the existence (Creation) and its
appearance (nature) so that you do not decide (determine) and fight unfairly between people of your kind
(human beings), but that you join yourselves with (fall in line with) the laws and recommendations as are given
to you through the teaching of the prophets, so that you do not secede from the truth and do not become
proponents of the ones who are unfaithful to the truth-teaching; and think about the true prophets from the
line of Nokodemion, they did not come to Earth to one people alone, but brought the teaching of the truth,
the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life to all peoples of your kind (humankind, all of humanity) so
that everyone may experience the truth of the wellspring of the existence (Creation) and everyone may direct
themselves according to its laws and recommendations; however, you have allowed that false prophets
amongst you could bring delusional teachings and that you were able to fall prey to these, therefore you were
disloyal to the way of the real truth and turned to gods and tin gods and their priests and other servants
(hands/helpers) so that you could pray to them; and your scribes who were entrusted by the prophets with
upholding the teaching by setting it down in writing, they falsified and slandered (calumniated) the teaching
of the true prophets and obfuscated it (rendered it unrecognisable) in such a wise that only a few grains of
real truth are contained in it.
  139) Truly, the fallible scribes who falsified, slandered (calumniated) and obfuscated (rendered unrecognisable) the
teaching of the prophets shall be excused in spite of their disgraceful doings, because they fell prey to an erro-
neous assumption when they falsified, slandered (calumniated) and obfuscated (rendered unrecognisable) the
truth-teaching in their writings due to false insight (understanding); but there were some amongst the scribes
who falsified, slandered (calumniated) and obfuscated (rendered unrecognisable) the teaching of the true
prophets deliberately because it is directed against their own belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods.
  140) Truly, you do not love any people of your kind (fellow human beings) who are villains and unfair ones (irrespon-
sible ones), but ask yourselves whether you are not yourselves also villains and unfair ones (irresponsible ones)
so that you do not defend yourselves if you deceive yourselves.
  141) Truly, you would like to conceal your maliciousness and inequity (unfairness) from people of your kind (fellow
human beings), but you cannot keep it concealed because you again and again forge intrigues (guilefulness)
openly or in secret and do evil and unfair things (irresponsible things) of all kinds; however, all your deeds are
seen through and are not approved.
  142) See, you defend your maliciousness and your inequity (unfairness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness),
your virtuelessness and your drunkenness (desire) and bad habits (vice), but you can never vindicate or defend
them, therefore you will find no advocates and no protectors amongst the righteous ones (conscientious ones)
and fair ones (responsible ones) of your kind (fellow human beings).
  143) When you do evil or unfair things (irresponsible things) against people of your kind (fellow human beings) or
against yourselves, against your inner nature or against your body or limbs (extremities), against life, the inner
world (consciousness) or the psyche, whether it be Gewaltsamkeit (torture) or defilement (injury) or killing,
then you are breaching the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all love (Creation), therefore you
will not find any calm or any peace, or any freedom and consonance (harmony) in yourselves because you can-
not bring forth any benevolence or any forbearance for yourselves and so you cannot forgive yourselves for
your ausgeartet doings.
  144) And whoever commits an unright, that human being only commits it against himself or herself even if others
are harmed thereby, because committing unright against other human beings gives rise to harm in one’s inner
nature and in addition it weighs on the admonishment (conscience) sooner or later.
  145) And as you commit unright against the true prophets, so you take a decision that casts yourselves into ruin; but consider that you cannot do any harm to the true prophets even if you slander (calumniate) them and their
  teaching, if you stalk them and try to kill them, because also the true prophets know very well how to protect themselves, according to the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the true love (Creation).
  146) Even before you, the prophets brought their teaching of the truth, their teaching of the spirit, their teaching
of the life to you and taught your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) everything that these did
not know about all the knowledge and all the wisdom, and you also do not know it, because like those be-
fore you who neglected the teaching and kindheartedness of the prophets, so you also neglect their great
kindheartedness and the teaching because you plot (conspire) in secret talks against the truth-teaching and the
true prophets, together with the priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of your fabulated (invented) and
unsubstantial (imaginary) gods and tin gods; truly, you do not conduct open talks on beneficence or kind-
heartedness and bringing about peace in order to admonish the people of your kind (human beings); when
you come together in talks, it is only in striving for your own pleasure and to stir one another up for battles
(wars) and to bring down punishments of death and acts of Gewalt (torture) on people of your kind (fellow
human beings) out of hatred and revenge and retaliation, for which you fallaciously believe that a magnificent
reward will be granted to you; but you are deluding yourselves vastly, because all your doings are of evil and
against all laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) as have always been taught to you by
the true prophets since time immemorial.
  147) Whoever amongst you sets themselves against the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
of the life despite the fact that the right way to true existence has become clear to them, but nevertheless they
follow a different way from that of the truth, they will have to follow a very difficult way because they will cast
themselves into a self-created shadow world (hell) as their own determination (decision) and burn in its fire,
and the way back to the truth will be seven times worse for them than at the time when they first found their
way to the truth.
  148) One day, your distant descendants will not be able to forgive you for your showing contempt to and slander-
ing (calumniate) the teaching of the prophets and the prophets themselves and being out for their blood; and
therefore your distant descendants (grandchildren, etc.) will not be able to forgive you because you are lead-
ing them into delusion and far from the truth with your false teachings, your false prophets and your priests
and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because your false teachings reach (extend/carry them-
selves forwards) into the farthest future and create delusion (influence) there for your belief of your godliness
(religion) because you do not follow the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all life
(Creation), but waste away far from it and set unsubstantial (imaginary) gods and tin gods at the side of the
wellspring of all life (Creation.
  149) Truly, whoever sets fabulated (invented) gods or tin gods or fabulated (invented) representatives (substitutes)
or others at the side of the primal wellspring of all wisdom (Creation) is indeed going very far into delusion;
and truly there are no gods or tin gods who could be creators (originators) of the firmaments (universe) and
of the earths (worlds/planets) and the heavenly lights (celestial bodies/comets/planets/moons/meteors/shooting
stars/nebulae), because the creation of all things in all firmaments (in the universe) and on all earths (worlds/
planets) is solely due to the primal wellspring of all wisdom (Creation), because truly it alone is the creative
power (energy) of all things and the unmeasurable secret.
  150) Those amongst you who have fallen prey to belief (assumptions) in your priests and other servants (hands/
helpers) of godliness (religion) and who make prayers (invocations/edification) to gods and tin gods, truly you
are only calling on lifeless and unsubstantial things (imaginary/non-existent things) and are thereby cursing the
truth of the Creation, so you are of evil and indignant ones against the truth and against the laws and recom-
mendations of the Creation.
  151) And those amongst you who call on unsubstantial (imaginary) gods and tin gods, you are cursing yourselves
and truly you are servants (hands/helpers) of your own suffering which strikes you at all times through your
own irrationality.
  152) Lend your ear to the true prophets and to their teaching, because truly it is they alone who do not lead you
into confusion, who do not lead you into hatred and battle (war), neither to revenge and retribution and nor
to punishment that is meted out with Gewalt or to killing, and it is only the true prophets who bring you the
teaching of the truth of the love and harmony, of the freedom and peace and who do not stir up vain wishes
in you and do not goad you into blindness (fanaticism) through which you kill your life (commit suicide) in order
to kill many others (murderous attacks) because you are led into confusion by blind belief and have fallen prey
to a hazy picture (delusion).
  153) Truly, you shall not cut off the ears of animals (not torment any animals) and not deface or destroy anything
that is given by the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation) in the firmaments (universe) and on earths (worlds/plan -
ets) and anyone who does so nonetheless stands in friendship with evil and wreaks evident loss all around to
what has been given by the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation) to all life for joy and for benefit (prosperity)
and for the preservation of existence.
154) Consider that false prophets and priests as well as all other servants of gods and servants of tin gods and all
 the rest in groups who are secessionists from the truth (sectists) or those who glorify themselves as (give them-
 selves out as/give themselves airs as) divinities and heightened ones (sublime ones) or as sect leaders are fooling
 you with promises and stirring up desires (vices/wantonness/pathological cravings/urges) in you and wishes of
 Ausartung and unright, because they are seducers and everything that they promise is pure delusiveness.
155) And truly, if you follow the seducers then you will find no way to escape from the darkness of your inequity
 (unfairness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness), so you will continue to founder in unknowledge of the
 truth and without giving the virtues enough consideration.
156) Truly, all those amongst you who do your good deeds and are connected to the truth and the laws and recom-
 mendations of the primal wellspring (Creation), you will create gardens of happiness in yourselves and cultiva-
 te (grow) plants of love and of knowledge and of wisdom, and streams of joy and of wellbeing will flow
 through the garden and allow peace and freedom and consonance (harmony) to prosper therein; this garden
 is your inner paradise which will forever dwell (live) in you, so you hold firm to it unswervingly and truthfully
 and care for your inner realm of pleasure (realm of the firmament/paradise).
157) Whoever amongst you does not however create the garden of knowledge, love and wisdom and therefore not
 the garden of freedom, peace and consonance (harmony) will create a shadow world (hell) with flaming (blazing)
 fire in themselves (in their nature), which will burn you up.
158) Truly, the laws and recommendations of the fullness of the life (Creation) do not go according to your wishes
 or the wishes of all peoples (humanity) because you and people of your kind (fellow human beings) have to
 fall in line with the laws and recommendations of the fullness of the life (Creation) so that you do rightfully
 and lead a pleasing life; if you do not heed the laws and recommendations of the fullness of the life (Creation)
 and if you do evil then you will find neither true friends nor helpers who stand by you in openness (honesty),
 and those who do not call themselves your friends, you will not find any grace from them.
159) If, however, you do good deeds, whether you are man or woman or child, and if you are connected to the
 truth then you will find true friends amongst people of your kind (like-minded ones), as also amongst those
 who are not attached to (connected to) the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the
 love (Creation) and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because they
 value (esteem) your good deeds and show you thanks.
160) And all of you, whether you are man or woman or child, you will build up in yourselves a pleasing (favourable)
 realm of pleasure (realm of the firmament/paradise), and you will not be aware of (feel) any unright in your-
 selves, not even the smallest iota of weight, because your reward is righteousness (conscientiousness) and vir-
 tuousness.
161) And who amongst you has greater knowledge and greater wisdom than you who are connected to the teach-
 ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, you who do good deeds and are upright
 ones in your righteousness (conscientiousness) and in your virtues and you who follow the laws and recom-
 mendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation)?; truly, those amongst you who are fair ones (responsible
 ones) and valiant in the fulfilment of your duties and your obligation (responsibility), life has you as its special
 friends.
162) Truly, the primal wellspring of all grace (Creation) is solely the truth of all reality (BEING) and the truth of all
 activity (existence) in the firmaments (universe), on the earths (worlds/planets) and whatever is in between
 (outer space), and it alone also encompasses all things of the life of each creature, of the waters, the airs, the
 firmness (stone/rock) and everything that crawls and flies.
163) If you are searching for a decision in the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all grace
 (Creation) concerning man and woman and child, then you will find it if you are in open willingness (of open
 sense); if your willingness (open sense) is not sufficiently skilful (educated) then rely on the teaching of the
 prophets which is the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, the teaching of
 the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all grace (Creation), in which you find the precious
 decision; and therefore act accordingly as is presented to you and taught to you through the truth-teaching of
 the prophets when you have to decide about orphans, when they want to enter into a bond (want to marry)
 so that you give them your help for everything that they need; and act equally in good decision according to
 right, law and recommendation if you have weak ones (disabled ones) amongst children so that they may also
 be given equitableness (fairness) and help in all things and so may have a good life; also practise equitableness
 (approval/fairness) in all things of right and law and of recommendations for the orphans so that they may lead
 an existence to the extent of everything necessary; and heed the rights of man and woman and of children so
 that no unright or Gewalt is done to them and they may lead their existence rightfully in freedom and peace
 and therefore in consonance (harmony) and not be starved of food or drink and not suffer want of provision
 for all the things they need.
164) And if, in a bond (marriage), a woman or a man fears rough treatment or unconcernedness from the other, then it shall be of rightness for both that they discuss the difficulty (problem) with one another in a seemly
wise and achieve reconciliation with one another, because reconciliation in righteousness (conscientiousness) and flawlessness (honesty) is truly the best so that peace may be brought about.
165) And make sure that you are not full of greed and avariciousness, whether you happen to be in a bond (mar-
 riage) or if you are unbound (single), because such doing brings unpeace and unfreedom in yourselves as well
 as dissonance (disharmony) and strife with people of your kind (fellow human beings); therefore it is better for
 you if you are truly versed in the laws and recommendations of the primal power of all life (Creation) and fol-
 low them so that you may turn to righteousness (conscientiousness) and to goodness.
166) Truly, it may be that no matter how greatly you may wish it, you cannot find any comprehensive equality
 (balance) between yourselves if you are connected in a bond (marriage) as man and woman, or if you are con-
 nected in a straightforward bond of inclination (lesbian/homosexual bond/unity) between man and man or
 woman and woman, because truly there cannot be a perfection in equitableness (balance), but only an ap-
 proximation (relativity/proportionality); therefore you can only achieve a limited (conditional) equality (balance)
 between yourselves, and even then only if you are inclined to one another and do not leave one another in
 abeyance (uncertainty); and if you act together in such a wise then your equality (balance) between one an-
 other will be excellent (the best); and if you do not separate and you are concerned to achieve an equality (bal-
 ance) between yourselves then your fullness of love and consonance (harmony) will make you independent
 from useless strivings about one another; and consider that if you are connected to one another in true love
 then you nevertheless (all the same) have to retain your independence (free will) so that you do not fall prey
 to unfreedom (subservience) to the other; truly it is both in a bond and not in a bond rightful that man and
 woman have their own opinion and may announce it also without inhibition (fear), and this also applies to chil-
 dren in such a wise that what is said shall not be punished providing it is not of unright.
167) Truly, everything that has been created in the firmaments (universe) and on earths (worlds/planets) is the act
 (deed) of the Creation, and also its laws and recommendations by means of which you are protected in your
 existence if you give them ampleness (sufficiency); and you receive the teaching of the truth, the teaching of
 the spirit, the teaching of the life through the true prophets by which you come to know the teaching of the
 laws and recommendations of the Creation so that you may turn yourselves to it and be knowing (conscious)
 in the truth and so you give yourselves satisfaction.
168) The firmaments (universe) and earths (worlds/planets) and all existence are created by the truth of the laws and
 recommendations of the primal power (Creation), so that you are present (existent) and you may dedicate
 yourselves to the duty of unfolding (evolution) of your inner world (consciousness).
169) If you want to, you can keep yourselves from learning the truth-teaching, but you cannot put others in your
 place who could bring fullness (sufficiency) to the learning of the truth-teaching and to the unfolding (evolu-
 tion) of your inner world (consciousness) for you (learning for you).
170) Whoever amongst you desires the reward of this world, may consider that the reward here below is always
 measured according to your conduct (behaviour) and how your deeds and words are evaluated.
171) And those amongst you who are firm in upholding (maintaining) equitableness (fairness), in righteousness
 (conscientiousness) and in the virtues, you are witnesses to the truth even if it is directed against yourselves or
 against your parents and siblings or against your children and relatives.
172) Whether you may be rich or poor, truly you all have the same rights and duties and obligation (responsibility)
 in all things whatever you do; therefore do not pursue base desires (vices/wantonness/pathological cravings/
 urges), so that you will always be capable, at any time and in all things, of acting according to equitableness
 (seemly/commensurate/modest/fair); and if you keep secret the truth in any things, if you falsify it or eschew
 it, then consider that it will push through to the light of day in good time and will accuse you as liars and slan-
 derers (calumniators) or as those withdrawing from (eschewing) the truth.
173) All of you, turn to the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all things (Creation) which are
 given to you by the teaching of the true prophets which they reveal to you and already revealed to your fore-
 fathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) so that you do not go into confusion in your existence and do
 not do unright.
174) Consider that if you become knowing (conscious) in the truth and then fall away from it again, but then come back to the truth a second time and to its teaching, and then fall away from it once more, that your unknowl-
edgeness will rain down over you to such an extent that you will not find your way back to the truth, and you
will wander on the way of ruin without forgiveness, directed by your false intentions (thoughts) and feelings.
175) Truly, those amongst you who are hypocrites, you yourselves are imposing a painful punishment on yourselves
 in your inner nature and in your psyche, because disguise (hypocrisy) makes you into outlaws (ostracised
 ones/outcasts) amongst people of your kind (fellow human beings).
 176) And those amongst you who take unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones)
 and depraved ones (ones without virtue) as your friends, are you by any chance looking for honour under their
 hands (with them)?; but consider true honour is only ever with the fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous
 ones (conscientious ones) and with the virtuous ones.
177) You hear that the teaching of the prophets has been given to you, the teaching of the laws and recommen-
 dations of the primal power (Creation), revealed by the true prophets, as you hear it, but those amongst you
 who do not want to learn the truth but rather deny and mock it, truly you do not want to hear the truth-teach-
 ing, but you sit with other deniers and mockers of the truth and do not want to pass over to a debate about
 the truth with them, so that you may not become knowing in the truth.
178) Those amongst you who are waiting for a good evaluation of yourselves, no success will be granted to you if
 you do not go hand-in-hand with the truth and do not strive for the truth, because truly even if you prove to
 be the stronger ones in existence whilst however guarding yourselves against the truth and not allowing it to
 become your own, then you will be the losers and will only receive bad evaluations of yourselves; truly, you
 decide over yourselves and you will never give yourselves the opportunity to prevail if you do not integrate (fall
 in line) with the real truth as is given by the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all equit-
 ableness (Creation).
179) The hypocrites amongst you, you, together with your false prophets and priests and with other worshippers
 of gods and worshippers of tin gods, are attempting to delude and deceive people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) so you lead them to pray to fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods and people of your kind (human
 beings) who appear as god-equivalents and heightened ones (sublime ones) and as representatives (substi-
 tutes) of gods and tin gods, but with your delusion and your deceit and your prayers (invocations/edifications),
 you are merely standing there so that people of your kind (human beings) may see you and you may shine
 before them in order to mislead them into the untruth whilst you yourselves do not think one iota about the
 real truth.
180) Truly, there are many amongst you who sway to and fro between the truth and the untruth and between this
 and that, and belong neither to the truth nor to the untruth, therefore you are always threatened with cast-
 ing yourselves into ruin because you do not find the way to the truth and to reality.
181) All those amongst you, you can give yourselves an evident proof of the truth only to yourselves, out of your
 inner nature, if you find the truth in yourselves through your own investigation (searching/researching), al-
 though this will only be of rightness if you keep away from the belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods which
 you are persuaded into by the godliness (religion) and its priests and other servants in erroneous assumption
 and in enticement.
182) Truly, those amongst you who are hypocrites, you are with no doubt creating a deep firing pit in yourselves in
 which you burn yourselves and you will not find any helpers to rescue you from the blaze.
183) But those amongst you who are sorry and better yourselves and turn away from your disguise (hypocrisy) and
 learn to hold yourselves sincerely and firmly to the truth and its teaching, you belong to those who receive a good
 reward in themselves because joy and happiness and therefore love, consonance (harmony) are current
 (present) in them; and those amongst you who are sincere and knowing (conscious) in the truth, you spread
 (give) your good reward of love and consonance (harmony) of freedom and peace also to people of your kind
 (fellow human beings), through which a new good reward will be granted to you.
184) And consider the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and that no punish-
 ments emanate from them, therefore you shall be thankful and shall not yourselves bring about any punish-
 ments, neither against yourselves nor against people of your kind (fellow human beings); therefore recognise
 the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) because they alone are included into equitable-
 ness (fairness) and true love, in contrast to the laws and recommendations that you yourselves make and which
 demand acts of Gewalt (torture) and killing (death penalty) as well as revenge and retaliation and battle (war)
 which are entirely unrightful.
185) It contradicts the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all existence (Creation) and there-
 fore of the true teaching of the prophets if you do unright, if you steal and rob, if you plunder and lie and
 deceive, if you slander and calumniate, if you practise amongst yourselves acts of Gewalt (torture) or other
 Gewalt and killing as a punishment and in battles (wars) or anywhere else.
186) And it is unrightful for you to make unseemly speeches openly (in public) or in secret, whether you happen to
 be in the right or in the unright, because the word and speaking only befit the dignity of appropriate seemli-
 ness.
187) If an unright happens to one amongst you then speak out for him or her in truth and equitableness (fairness),
 but do not debase yourselves by making unseemly remarks and speeches for him or her, because they are not
 only unbecoming (improper/inappropriate) of dignity but they also cause harm to the one to whom unright is
 done.
 188) Whether you announce a good deed or conceal it is a matter of your attitude; but it is better to do good deeds
 in secret so you do not show conceit (stand out/raise yourselves) before people of your kind (fellow human
 beings), because truly doing good deeds in secret is full of goodness and dignity, but announcing the good
 deed detracts from its value and seriousness.
189) If harm is done to you through an evil deed or by defamatory statement (calumny), then forgive the evildoer
 so that neither hatred nor the pathological craving for revenge or retaliation may come alive in you; thus truly
 be the redeemers of the infamous actions (crimes) of those who do harm to you, lie to you and deceive you
 or slander (calumniate) you; do not be like the unfair ones (irresponsible ones), thus do not repay evil with evil
 or harm with harm, so that you may always be of good admonishment (conscience) and can enjoy your glad-
 ness in honesty.
190) And truly, those amongst you who make a differentiation between the true teaching of the prophets, which
 is the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) and existence (life), you
 do not understand the truth and will not find the way to it, because you are attempting to strike a way in
 between them (middle way).
191) But truly, those of you who wish to take a way in between (middle way), you are preparing disparaging joyless-
 ness in yourselves because there is no way in between (middle way), between the real truth and the unreal
 untruth.
192) Those amongst you who are knowing (conscious) about the truliness of the primal wellspring (Creation) and
 the truliness of the prophets and their teaching, you are striving for the truth and equitableness (fairness); and
 therefore do not make any differentiation amongst people of your kind (human beings) as created creations
 (human beings), but only in their bearing (behaviour).
193) And truly, those of you who are fair to people of your kind (human beings) as a created Creation (human
 being), you receive for this in yourselves a good reward of love from people of your kind (love for human
 beings/love for the next one).
194) Even long before your time, many of your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) demanded of the
 true prophets that they should give you the writing of their teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teach-
 ing of the life so that they would have it before their eyes time and time again; and truly, several of the true
 prophets from the line of Nokodemion, the originator of the truth-teaching, select (look for) people amongst
 you who are able to write so that they should set down (record) the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life in writing for all coming time and for all descendants (children of children, etc.);
 but truly, throughout all of time all the scribes entrusted with this task falsify and slander (calumniate) the
 truth-teaching of the prophets so that all words are twisted (distorted) and rendered unrecognisable; but this
 had already been foreseen at an early stage so that the scribes entrusted with the task were encouraged to
 report (write down) the teaching of the prophets conscientiously, but they never paid attention to this; but the
 confidence is maintained that the teaching will after all be recorded recognisably by responsibility-conscious
 ones, although there is no great confidence in this respect because those who know how to write always have
 the sense of incorporating their own explanations (interpretations) into the writing and form it according to
 their opinion; truly, it was chosen (decided) that in the new time the scrolls of the teaching of the prophets will
 be set down (recorded) by the one who is probably the most versed in writing and the last prophet from the
 line of Nokodemion, in his own writing and in an understandable language for all those who are looking for
 the way to the truth, so that they may find it.
195) Consider at all times that there is no-one amongst the people, neither man nor woman, who, if given the task
 of setting something down, can authentically reflect the given word of the truth-teaching because each one
 feels the urge to perpetuate (immortalise) their own views (thoughts/imaginations) and explanations (interpre-
 tations), which explains why they defile (falsify) the word that is announced to them (dictated word) and why
 only slanders (calumnies) and lies as well as delusions and distortions (falsifications) are retained as handed-
 down knowledge (tradition/chronicle); however, this will not be the case in the new time because the last pro-
 phet from the line of Nokodemion, comprehensively fulfilling his matter of admonishment (matter of con-
 science/matter of honour/duty), will set down (record) the teaching of the truth of the laws and recommenda-
 tions of the primal wellspring of all love (Creation) and therefore the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life in his own writing and without defilement (falsification) in many scrolls so that
 everything may be of permanence.
196) And truly, the last prophet from the line of Nokodemion will make the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life obvious (understandable) to you in the far-off time (far descendants), so that there
 will no longer be any doubt in the understanding and you will no longer worship gods and tin gods; the signs
 (marvels/ evidence) of the true prophet of the new time will be seen and recognised (understood) by his like-
 minded companions so that they will carry his signs (evidence) and the teaching into the time to come (future)
 so that in the far-off time there will be true love and freedom amongst the peoples (humankind) of Earth, as
 well as peace and consonance (harmony).
 197) And the true prophet of the new time will live high on the top of the mountain that will resemble a horse-
 shoe, and he will carry forth the signs (evidence) of peace, freedom, love and consonance (harmony) and the
 teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life throughout the whole earth so that
 his signs (evidence/marvels) and the teaching will be clear to all people of your kind (humankind) and they
 conclude a bond (agreement) with the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all
 wisdom (Creation).
198) Step through the door of the cognition into the truth-teaching so that you no longer neglect and contravene
 the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all existence (Creation); therefore you shall conclude
 a bond (agreement) with the truth and do rightfully in all things.
199) Enter into a bond (contract) with the truth and do not break it like your forefathers and foremothers (ances-
 tors/forebears) did when they denied the signs (evidence) of the truth of the primal wellspring of all existence
 (Creation) and iniquitously slandered (calumniated) the teaching of the prophets and attempted to kill the
 prophets; truly, do not be like them who carelessly neglected their benevolence and sealed up their under-
 standing.
200) Do not break the bond (agreement) with the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring
 of all existence (Creation) once you have concluded it, so that you do not once again start to misconstrue the
 signs (evidence) of the truth and become unknowing again, and do not turn yourselves to gods and tin gods
 once more.
201) So that you may be knowing (conscious) in the truth, you shall turn yourselves away from your gods and tin
 gods and from your priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods who all together speak slanders
 (calumnies) against the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and against the
 true prophets and their teaching.
202) Truly, those amongst you who are in disunity and doubt regarding the real truth and its teaching, you do not
 have truthful (unfalsified) tidings from the truth-teaching, rather you are simply following a conceivableness
 (assumption) and you cannot turn this into certainty.
203) Those amongst you who live in unright and do evil and slander and infringe against the laws and recommen-
 dations of the primal wellspring (Creation), forbid yourselves your wrong doing and only permit yourselves to
 do what is rightful, so that you no longer remain secessionists from the truth and only do clear things.
204) And if you speak about the truth and teach it, then do not take payment for it, because you shall not be al-
 lowed to turn the truth-teaching into commerce when you are teaching (instructing) it to the ones who are
 unknowing in the truth and therefore to the ones who are searching for the truth; only take a payment for
 this if it is given to you out of love and kindheartedness and given freely as a gift without your asking for it;
 and therefore you shall only take a payment in order to pay your costs which accrue to you when you are
 producing writings for which you yourselves have to give a payment; and in this wise the payment is rightful
 so that you do not suffer any disadvantage and may further spread the teaching of the truth, the teaching of
 the spirit, the teaching of the life.
205) And it is not allowed for the ones who are truth-knowing to be recompensed as teachers for instructing the people in the truth-teaching by their municipality (community) or by the people (state), unless those who are
thirsting for truth freely give forth gifts so that the instructing ones (teachers) may cover their living expenses.
206) And it is rightful that you do not pay false prophets and priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin
 gods, and do not build for them any temples (houses of gods and houses of tin gods) or houses of prayer, so
 that they do not become mighty over the peoples (humankind) and lead them into delusion and plunder
 (exploit) them with their false teachings; truly, if you pay the false prophets, the priests and other worshippers
 of gods and worshippers of tin gods, and if you build for them temples (houses of gods/houses of tin gods),
 then they will take you and turn you into their servants in belief and will steal your possessions and your wealth
 (fortune), because their guilefulness knows no limits (is boundless).
207) And instruct (teach) your descendants amongst yourselves in the teaching of the laws and recommendations
 of the wellspring of all love (Creation), the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the
 life, once they have grown out of feeding at the mother’s breast (suckling) so that, even from an early age,
 they may be knowing (conscious) in dealing with the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all love
 (Creation) and with the laws of the appearance (nature); but the instruction shall be an instruction only, not
 however a coercion, so that the descendants may decide for themselves at a later age whether they wish to
 follow the truth-teaching or not.
208) And it is rightful that children shall be taught (instructed) in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life at special places of learning (schools) based on free determination (decision); however,
all instructing ones and preparing ones (educating ones) shall be concerned with instructing (teaching) the
children in the truth-teaching so that they may find the true way to the existence (life) and may tread and fulfil
(accomplish) it in equitableness (fairness) and righteousness (conscientiousness) as well as in the truth-knowl- edge and in all virtues.
209) You shall teach your children so that they are firmly grounded (taught) in the knowledge of all things of the
 existence (life) and in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, therefore
 also in the things of the life, dying and death, so that they do not worry about life and do not have one iota
 of uncertainty and so that the greatest reward of the life may be granted to them.
210) Truly, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life is grounded (founded) on the
 laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all life (Creation) and it is created by Nokodemion, the
 originator of the truth-teaching, and therefore after his demise (passing away) the true prophets from his line
 revealed the teaching again and anew over lengthy periods of time, so that true love and consonance (har-
 mony) as well as peace and freedom shall be amongst all people of your kind (humankind).
211) The true prophets have come to you since time immemorial, amongst others who raised themselves up as false
 prophets, bringing teachings of unoccurrence (unreality) and founded many religions through which the many
 cults came about, all of which are far from the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power
 of all things (Creation).
212) The true prophets have been, since time immemorial, bringers of joyful news through the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, and therefore they are also admonishers and reveal plagues
 (misery/want/war/fight/unfortune, etc.) and disaster (catastrophes/destruction, etc.) for the coming time so
 that you consider them and change your actions and effects and your attitude (mentality) and lead them to
 the good so that the things do not occur which had been announced (proclaimed) by the true prophets as a
 warning of threatening plagues (misery/want/war/fight/unfortune, etc.) and troubles (evil happenings) and
 disaster (catastrophes/destruction, etc.).
213) The true prophets provide evidence through their revelations, through their teaching that they bring you, and
 through their signs (marvels) that they allow you to see that only the truth of the laws and recommendations
 of the Creation is able to guide everything in mightiness (mightfully) in all firmaments (universe) and on all
 earths (worlds/planets) and the heavenly lights (celestial bodies/suns/galaxies).
214) However, those amongst you who are unknowing in all things of the truth-teaching, truly, you have gone far
 astray, so you are persisting in the unknowledge about the truth and carrying out unright, so you cannot for-
 give yourselves and neither may you guide yourselves onto the right way.
215) Truly, if you are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and ones without
 virtue, then you are walking on the way of the shadow world (hell) which destroys you in your inner and burns
 you up in its flames.
216) Be knowing (conscious) that the true prophets come to you so that you become open to the truth and may be
 able to differentiate between what is good and what is evil, and so that you do only good for yourselves and
 for people of your kind (fellow human beings) and keep yourselves away from everything disastrous that you
 are able to commit in evil through hatred and the pathological craving for revenge, and through retaliation and
 jealousy.
217) Consider at all times the truth and the laws and recommendations of the power of all reality (Creation) and
 open your ear to the teaching of the prophets as you shall also heed their signs (marvels) that they do so that
 you may recognise the truth of all truth and be connected to it alone.
218) And when you think of the prophets, then make sure not to insult them by putting them on a level with false
 prophets and the priests of gods and tin gods to whom you pay homage (show extolment), because the true
 prophets do not tolerate any homage (extolment/glorification) and reject such doings; consider, all of the gods
 and tin gods are fabulated (invented) unsubstantialities without character (body/consistency/content), to whom
 equally no homage shall be paid as also not to their priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of any gods and
 tin gods, but also not to any other people of your kind (human beings), whoever and whatever and however
 they may be.
219) And do not pay homage to (glorify) either concoctors (founders/originators/creators) of pieties (religions) or
 concoctors (founders/originators/creators) and provosts of pious (religious) customs and rites (sects/cults),
 because they are only servants (hands/helpers) of fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods or of those who raise
 themselves up as gods and tin gods or to the state of heightened ones (sublime ones).
220) And therefore do not pay homage to (bow down before) any battle leaders (warlords), because their deeds are evil and against the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of all wisdom (Creation) concerning the life,
love, freedom, peace, consonance (harmony) and the preservation of everything created by people of your kind
(human beings); and if authorities and rulers or battle leaders (warlords) instigate battles (wars) then stand as
a whole people in gewaltsamer Gewaltlosigkeit against them and refuse them your services, because every type
of battle (war) is against the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all existence (Creation),
against the dignity of people of your kind (human beings) and against all the right of the life, which teaches
that there shall be no killing (murdering) in Ausartung, but only then if a life-threatening emergency (self-
defence) makes it necessary; however, a life-threatening emergency (self-defence) does not arise through acts
of battle (acts of war) and the like, because truly acts of battle (acts of war) amount to bloody deeds (murder) committed in consciousness (consciously).
221) And therefore it is also a bloody deed (murder) to cast away one’s own life (commit suicide) in the delusion of
 godliness (religious delusion) and also through pious (religious) hatred and pious (religious) fervour (fanaticism),
 in order thereby to rip others out of the life (into the death) by these means (assassination).
222) And consider that the laws and recommendations of the primal power of all life (Creation) also do not give
 any right to wage holy (consecrated) battles (wars) against people of your kind (fellow human beings) because
 falsifiers of scrolls are slandering (calumniating) the teaching of the prophets and bringing dishonour upon it
 and making you stupid thereby; and also it is not given by any laws and recommendations of the primal power
 of all life (Creation) that you shall wage holy (consecrated) battles (wars) for the purpose of godliness (religious
 war) in order to coerce (proselytise) believers in gods or tin gods to your belief (assumptions); and therefore it
 is beneath all right of the laws and recommendations of the primal power of all life (Creation) to bring about
 calamity and spread death and destruction amongst people of your kind (fellow human beings) through pious
 (religious) Gewalt (terror) so that people of your kind (fellow human beings) suffer harm to body and life and
 possessions as well as in their inner world (consciousness) and psyche; truly, the dignified (honoured/controlled)
 battle (war) presented by the true prophets and through their teaching is the holy (consecrated) battle (war)
 against yourselves, the fight against yourselves in your inner nature so that you form it for righteousness (con -
 scientiousness) and equitableness (fairness) as well as greatheartedness (dignity) and esteem, and so that all-
 embracing love and consonance (harmony) as well as peace and freedom may come about in you in dignity
 and deference.
223) And never exceed the limits of the life which are set so that you may heed all life and treat it in respect, whet-
 her it be people of your kind (human) or the life of animals and of creatures (birds/fishes/snakes and all crea-
 tures that are not regarded as mammals); and as you kill animals or creatures (birds/fishes/snakes and all crea-
 tures that are not regarded as mammals) for your nourishment, do not slaughter (kill) them disgracefully by
 cutting through the neck of the animals or creatures (kosher/halal slaughter), as you are confusingly led to do
 by false prophets and priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because doing this to animals and
 creatures (birds/fishes/snakes and all creatures that are not regarded as mammals) is just as much of a mur-
 derer's doing (killer's doing) as when you do the same to people of your kind (human beings); therefore it is
 taught that killing animals and creatures is indeed rightful for you providing it serves the need for obtaining
 nourishment or amounts to another act of necessity, but at the same time it is given that the animal or crea-
 ture shall not undergo any pain, but that it shall be killed in such a wise that it does not realise that it is dying;
 and therefore neither an animal nor a creature shall be struck or mistreated in another wise or exposed to tor-
 ments because it too has a psyche, and therefore the animal and the creature also feel pain and suffering like
 people of your kind (human beings).
224) And just as you shall pay heed to animals and creatures, so you shall also pay heed to your world and not bring
 affliction or pain on it by bringing misery upon it (harassing it) through your unfolding (progress) and your gains
 (achievements) and by the large numbers of people of your kind (humankind); and do not go forth and multi -
 ply like vermin, because as vermin destroys itself when it spreads uncontrolled, so would also happen to you
 by you bringing about your own downfall.
225) And do not exceed the limits in your knowledge and always remain with the truth, because as you exceed your
 knowledge you bring your inner world (consciousness) and your true discernment (intellect) into confusion and
 you fall prey to megalomania, so that you then drive people of your kind (humankind) and your world to
 downfall (catastrophes).
226) And think about the truth at all times, namely that true prophets are not envoys of a god or tin god and are
 not servants (hands/helpers) of priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods, because they
 appoint themselves to their task (mission) through their own efforts (determination/empowerment) and
 through their own power and responsibility, so you shall not assume anything else.
227) And consider that if you know all about this truth of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
 teaching of the life that emanates from the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring
 of all wisdom (Creation) then you will give a full reward for your inner world (consciousness) and your psyche,
 as also for your inner nature so that you may be in gladness full of happiness in true love, peace and freedom
 and consonance (harmony).
228) However, there are many amongst you who mistreat your inner nature and therefore your inner world (con-
 sciousness) and your psyche, making killers’ pits (murderers’ pits) out of it because you do not follow the truth
 of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of the life (Creation) but nonsensically create your
 own and false laws and recommendations which deny all truth so that you can thereby satisfy all of your vo-
 racity and vice, your avarice, your unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and your inequity (unfairness/irrespon-
 sibility).
229) You do not give any grace (favour) to the truth that you can increase, rather you disdain it and you are proud that you can live according to your own unfair (irresponsible) laws and recommendations; but all of you who
 live according to this false sign (pattern), you will find neither a true friend nor a helper amongst people of
 your kind (fellow human beings).
230) All of you, since you came into existence (were created as human beings) have been given the signs of mira-
 cles (outstanding things) as the evidence of the reality (existence) of the laws and recommendations of the pri-
 mal wellspring of all wisdom (Creation) and the laws of appearance (nature), therefore a clear light of the truth
 has been given to you; allow yourselves to be led by the light of the truth so that it may go well with you in
 all things of existence (life); therefore, you are advised to follow the instruction of the teaching of the truth,
 the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life so that you may be fair and righteous (conscientious) and vir-
 tuous and all of you may be treated alike, man and woman and child, and that you are rightful to them in all
 things; and do not play one off against another, but respect one another in honourableness and equality so
 that none of you may be more than another, whether man or woman or child; therefore one shall not receive
 more than another, but everything shall be apportioned to all in equitableness (fairness) with equal propor-
 tions, as must be arranged by the apportionment and the right thereto; therefore the equal distribution also
 applies to heritages so that male and female descendants receive equal shares of their inheritance, without any
 differentiation.
