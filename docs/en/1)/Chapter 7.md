# Chapter 7
1) This is the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, which is the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life given through the laws and recommendations of the appearance (nature) and the wellspring of the
 love (Creation); allow yourselves to be led (guided) by the teaching which is also the teaching of the prophets
 who teach you so that no trepidation may arise in your breast (feelings) and so that you may be warned as an
 admonishment so that you do not do unrightful things.
2) Follow what has been given to you through the truth-teaching, and do not follow any other protector than
 the real truth; how little you are mindful of this (how little you think about it).
3) Remember what has gone before (the past), because you have destroyed so many cities and killed (murdered)
 the inhabitants out of revenge, hatred, jealousy and enmity when you fell upon them by day or in the night
 whilst they were sleeping; and truly, you also do the same today because you have not freed yourselves from
 your unright; and those amongst you who have freed themselves from it, you have contempt for them and
 you accuse them of chickenheartedness (cowardice) when they protect their lives and people of their kind
 (family members), because you want them to be people of your kind (people just like you) so that they join
 you in killing and destruction.
4) However, if you are called to account for your outrage (murdering and destruction, etc.), then you yourselves
 fall prey to chickenheartedness (cowardice) and you bewail yourselves and make supplications for undeserved
 mercy in false remorse; but then, if equitableness (fairness) catches up to you, feign realisation of your infa-
 mous actions (crimes) and admit that you are malefactors (lawbreakers), but because your remorse is only a
 game you will continue your outrages (lawbreaking activities) unless you are brought to fair (commensurate)
 punishment and sent to a place of fulfilment of guidelines (secluded island or secluded place) for a certain
 period of time.
5) Truly, all those who are outrageous (breaking the law) will be brought to account, and if it is not through the law of condition (cause) and decision (effect = cause and effect) of the wellspring of the love (Creation) then it will be
through the jurisdiction and its laws which you have conceived (created) as people of your kind (human beings).
6) And the laws conceived (created) by you will be implemented by your jurisdiction and authority because they
 are ever present and never absent when they have to condemn you; and they also will enumerate your actions
 to you which you have committed with knowledge and thereby infringed the law, so you will be judged ac-
 cording to your actions and sent for punishment.
7) And the weighing (assessing) of your actions will be conducted truly harshly by your jurisdiction or authority,
 because everything will be put into the scales of equitableness (fairness) and will amount to a great weight
 because nothing will be left out that you have done in unright and infamous actions (crimes).
8) And truly, there are many amongst you who have your own scales for yourselves which drag you down under
 because of their weight, because your lovelessness and unfreedom (bondage) in you as well as your dissonance
 (disharmony) and your own unpeace as well as your chickenheartedness (cowardice) weigh so heavily that you
 cannot free yourselves from them, because you constantly commit misdemeanours against the signs (teaching/
 evidence) of the truth.
9) A dwelling has been given to you on Earth through the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the
 love (Creation), as has the land, so that you may build on it and thereby create the means for your welfare, but
 you defile your dwelling and the land because you are ungrateful; and in your ungratefulness you are presump-
 tuous and you assume (believe) that you may place yourselves next to the wellspring of the love (Creation).
10) You are created from the appearance (nature) of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation), and it is from the appearance (nature) that your form has also come forth, however also your free-
 dom (autonomy) so that you are independent in your determinations (decisions) and in your power to act (will)
 and you do not have to submit yourselves to the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) if
 you do not strive to do so; but consider in this that even if you have your free determination (decision) and
 your free power to act (will), you are nevertheless integrated into the activity of the laws and recommenda-
 tions of the wellspring of the love (Creation), therefore your actions bring forth distinct decisions (effects) (law
 of cause and effect).
11) And as you are not coerced to submit yourselves to the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the
 love (Creation) therefore you can always act according to free determination (decision) and in free power to
 act (will), so you shall not submit yourselves to people of your kind (human beings) either, and not to baseless
 (supposed/made up) gods and tin gods or liberators (angels).
12) You shall always prevent yourselves from submitting yourselves because ample freedom has been given to you
 in all things and for your life and everything that is in it, therefore it is beneath your dignity for you to submit
 yourselves whether it be submission to someone of your kind (human being), to a fabulated (invented) god,
 tin god, liberator (angel), venerable one (holy one) or to anything else.
13) Consider that in your freedom (autonomy) you are always better than those who demand submission from
 you; therefore you shall heed your freedom and keep it for always.
14) And do not believe in false prophets and false believers, who bind themselves to gods and tin gods and believe that they have been created by the same from fire (breath) or from loam, because everything is only lying and
slander (calumny), because you have been created from the earth and its appearance (nature) through its cycle
(processes) of unfolding (evolution) from which animated (organic) acids (amino acids) were created and from which
the minutest creatures (micro organisms), and truly people of your kind (human beings) came about from that.
15) Therefore do not be slimily subservient and assume (believe) that you have come forth from the fire (breath)
 of a god or tin god or through its might and kindheartedness from loam; truly, it is not appropriate to open
 your ears to this delusional teaching, and if you do so nevertheless then you are making yourselves into abased
 ones who are bound to (dependent on) fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods.
16) Allow yourselves only to see the truth, to accept it and to live with it so that you do not need to demand defer-
 ment in order to understand the truth.
17) And truly, if you follow the truth, then you are not lost, therefore you do not condemn yourselves either to
 having unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) lying in wait for you, who
 certainly want to lead you away from the straight way of the truth.
18) If you observe people of your kind (fellow human beings) who have done evil and unfair things (irresponsible
 things) to you, then do not wish them evil and unfair things (irresponsible things) from all sides, but forgive
 them even if you find the majority of them are not grateful for it.
19) And if people of your kind (fellow human beings) do evil and unfair things (irresponsible things) to you and are
 unrighteous (conscienceless) towards you, then do not disdain them and do not push them away, but do not
 do as they do so that you do not create a shadow world (hell) in yourselves that you fill with unright, with evil
 and with unrighteousness (consciencelessness).
20) You people of your kind (human being), man and woman, dwell in a garden of peace and love, of freedom
 and of consonance (harmony), which you create in yourselves, and eat from all the good fruits thereof, wher -
 ever and whenever you wish; however, do not create in yourselves a garden in which fruits of lovelessness, of
 unpeace, of dissonance (disharmony), of unfreedom (bondage) grow as well as trees (conditions) of inequity
 (unfairness).
21) Always consider that many amongst you are unfair ones (irresponsible ones), unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and virtueless ones, and they are always concerned to whisper evil to you and to plant a tree (condition)
of shame in you so that you will be ashamed to liberate yourselves from unright and evil, and so that you as-
sume that the truth is forbidden to you so that you do not become fair ones (responsible ones), righteous ones
(conscientious ones) and not full of virtues; and those who do evil and who are unfair ones (irresponsible ones),
they are companions of the false prophets and other false teachers, of the priests, servants of gods and ser-
vants of tin gods, who present you the illusion that you are protected by liberators (angels) and that you will have eternal life if you commit (obligate yourselves) to the false teachings of the false prophets as well as the priests, gods and tin gods.
22) And be heedful, because the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), the
 virtueless ones, the priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods are continually concerned to
 catch you in their rapacious clutches, and they lie to you with vows that they are your good and sincere ad-
 visers, although they are not because truthly they only lead you into delusion and attempt to cast you down
 into the abysses and into the darkness of unknowledgeness of the truth.
23) They deceive you through lies and deception to sample from the tree of evil that grows in them and to eat its fruits so that you may become the same as them, so you are ashamed to live with the truth; and if they suc-
ceed in persuading you to eat their evil fruits then you take the leaves of their evil garden and wrap yourselves
inside them, so that the truth remains closed to you and you do not realise that evil is your obvious enemy.
24) And if evil takes possession of you, then you bring shame down upon yourselves, and you cannot either for-
 give yourselves or take pity upon yourselves because you make yourselves into ones who are lost from the
 truth.
25) And as you are lost ones from the truth, so you are also lost ones and enemies against yourselves, as you make yourselves into enemies against people of your kind (fellow human beings); and truly, as you are enemies
against yourselves on Earth and enemies against people of your kind (next ones), so you make your home
planet into a shadow world (hell) and place of existence for a limited time, because you wreak destruction on
the appearance (nature) and destroy your world through battles (wars) and hatred as well as through jealousy,
through pathological craving for revenge and pathological craving for retaliation and through everything evil.
26) Truly, you only live on your world for a limited period (one lifetime), and you also die thereat in order to be
 brought forth from the life-in-death (death-life) as a new individual being (personality), when your spirit-body
 (spirit-form) is reawakened (reincarnated).
27) Truly, the truth is given to you through the teaching of the prophets, this being the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, so that you may have a clothing (protection) through it, by means
of which you can cover your shame with regard to the untruth and you can free yourselves from it, so that the
clothing (protection) may become a pleasing garment (security) for you in order to learn the truth-teaching;
but consider that the garment (security) shall be a dress of the truth for you, but not a dress of the godliness
(religion), so you are not attached to false prophets, priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of gods and tin
gods; therefore heed the signs (evidence) of the truth so that you may always think of (be reminded of) this.
28) Oh people of your kind (human beings) all around, do not allow the evil and unfair (irresponsible) things to deceive you, and do not allow yourselves to be driven out of your good garden in yourselves, rather always
wear the clothing (knowledge) of the truth and do not allow it to be robbed from you so that you do not have
to be ashamed of yourselves in front of yourselves and also in front of people of your kind (fellow human
beings); truly, be careful that you do not become propitious (well-disposed/inclined) towards the untruth and
are not overrun by the crowd of unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) if
you do not see their secret doings by means of which they want to deceive you, because see, the unfair ones
(irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) harbour evil towards you, because they are
themselves caught up in it since they have made evil their friend through not being connected to the truth.
29) And if the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) commit an infamous
 action (crime) then they think they are in the right because their forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/fore-
 bears) had already made the same deed their own which they had commanded themselves to do; but truly,
 the laws and recommendations of the appearance (nature) and therefore the laws and recommendations of
 the wellspring of the love (Creation) never command infamous actions (crimes) of any kind whatsoever, nei-
 ther lovelessness, hatred and revenge nor retaliation, jealousy or outrages of any kind (murder, killing, man -
 slaughter, crimes, torture, act of Gewalt, violation, etc.), nor lovelessness, unpeace and unfreedom (bondage)
 and dissonance (disharmony); this is taught by the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teach-
 ing of the life so that you may understand and follow it; therefore what do you want to say against the truth
 if you do not understand it (do not realise it), and what do you want to say about the truth if you know noth-
 ing of it?
30) The wellspring of the love (Creation) has recommended (included) equitableness (fairness) in its laws and
 recommendations and in those of the appearance (nature), therefore you shall search with attentiveness for
 this equitableness (fairness) and shall follow it at all times, so you are always open in honest knowledge when
 striving (endeavouring) to search for edification, so that you always return to equitableness (fairness) in the
 wise that you found it.
31) Truly, a certain proportion amongst you is well led (guided) by the truth, because you have made it your own, but another portion amongst you is in doubt between the truth and untruth, because you do not find the way
to the truth, and another portion amongst you has erroneous assumption meted out to you in a fitting wise
(own wrong behaviour), because you have made friends with evil and the unfair (irresponsible), as well as with the unrighteous (conscienceless), with Gewalt (terror) and coercion as well as with all terrible things, and you fallaciously assume (believe) that you would be rightly led therewith.
32) People of your kind (human beings), put on your jewellery at any time of your choosing, pursue your enjoy-
 ments, visit places of edification and take pleasure in this and that, and eat and drink, but do not exceed the
 limits (boundaries) in doing this, so that you always do rightful and fair (responsible) things, so you do not get
 very badly out of the control of the good human nature and do not fall prey to immoderacy.
33) And do not wear jewellery for gods and tin gods, but only in accordance with your fancy for your beauty, and
 therefore also do not wear jewellery for services to gods and services to tin gods, and not for the priests and
 other servants (hands/helpers) of gods and tin gods, and also not for the false prophets and those who practise
 godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults); and do not wear jewellery for the good things and the
 provision (subsistence) that is given to you through the wellspring of the love (Creation), because truly it does
 not need your jewellery, and therefore jewellery is only intended for your own requirement for the sake of beauty;
 and as you act in this wise you are connected to the truth for all the days in this life; and therefore this part of
 the teaching is given as a sign (evidence) for people of your kind (human beings) who have cognisance of the
 truth.
34) Truly, through the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), all disgracefulnesses (badnesses) are not recommended to people of your kind (human beings) through upholding (maintaining)
insight (rationality) and true discernment (intellect), neither those which are committed openly (in public) nor
those which are done in secret; thus, however, disgracefulnesses (badnesses) are Gewalt (terror) and coercion
and everything that you place next to the wellspring of the love (Creation) which you have no right (entitlement)
to do; and therefore it is disgracefulness (badness) if you curse the wellspring of the love (Creation) and say
things about it which are the untruth and what you do not know of it; and disgracefulness (badness) is inside
and outside of you, as well as lovelessness and unpeace, unfreedom (bondage), dissonance (disharmony) and
also hatred and pathological craving for revenge, pathological craving for retaliation and jealousy, strife and
battle (war), bloody deed (murder), outrage (act of Gewalt and coercion), inequity (unfairness), causing harm to
the body and life and the psyche and the inner world (consciousness), as well as misdeeds (crimes) of all kinds.
35) For every action, a time is set at which a reckoning will be demanded for it, and when the hour has come then
 the demand for reckoning cannot be put off by even one moment, nor can it be postponed, be it by your juris-
 diction or through the primal (creative) law of condition (cause) and decision (effect = cause and effect).
36) Consider, if true prophets come to you from your midst who present (teach) you all the signs (evidence) of the
 teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, then they come to point out (reveal)
 to you the way to the real truth in respect (venerability) so that you may do good deeds through the truth and
 no fear and no sorrow may come over you over which you cannot prevail (master).
37) Those amongst you, however, who condemn the signs (teaching, the explanations and marvels) of the true
 prophets and turn yourselves away from them with disdain, you are the inhabitants of an evil fire (unknowledge)
 and inequity (unfairness) in yourselves, in which you tarry so long until you bethink yourselves.
38) And truly, those amongst you who fabulate (invent) lies against the truth and against the true prophets or who
 accuse (blame) their signs (marvels) of being lies and deception, you choose your own destiny by afflicting your-
 selves with unpeace and unfreedom (bondage) as well as lovelessness and dissonance (disharmony) against
 yourselves, because truly, instead of you turning to the truth, you are accustomed to calling on and praying to
 gods and tin gods and people of your kind (human beings) despite the fact that you cannot find in them the
 truth and neither advantage (success) nor disadvantage (loss/damage) therefore you give an evil testimony
 against yourselves, against your own power and your own action (capability).
39) Those of you who are against the truth, you foment in yourselves a fire of evil and you band together with throngs of people of your kind (like-minded ones); and if one of your throngs meets another throng then you
curse one another so that the ones talks badly about the others and yet once again return to doing terrible
things together; but you also lead one another into delusion and deceive one another, therefore you are befallen
doubly by anguish and the fire of hatred, and no righteous (conscientious) friendship comes about amongst you.
40) And those of you who are against the truth, you are unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and unfair ones
 (irresponsible ones) in yourselves and amongst one another, therefore you say to the others that they do not
 have any benefit (advantage) over you and are even worse than you are, and by doing so you bring forth hatred
 and strife amongst yourselves and start to strike and to kill one another.
41) Truly, you unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) you condemn all signs (evidence) of certain (actual) truth and turn away from it with disdain, although in doing so you do not realise
how you are increasingly closing off your inner world (consciousness) to the true existence (reality) and are withering in your world of thoughts and feelings as well as in your psyche; truthly, you cannot open your fir- mament of your inner world (consciousness) and cannot go into its firmament (consciousness-levels) in order to fathom them and to gain unfolding (evolutive) advantage (success) from them, and truly a camel would be more likely to pass through the eye of a needle than for you to turn to the truthly truth without you first suf- fering great and painful harm and a serious calamity because you are truthfully great malefactors and only learn through harm and calamity.
42) And see that it is only if you turn to the truth in good measure and follow the teaching of the truth, the teach- ing of the spirit, the teaching of the life, and if you learn from it and do good deeds both for yourselves and
also for all people of your kind (fellow human beings), who always meet you and who need your help, only
then do you cease to burden yourselves with inequity (unfairness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness) as
well as with virtuelessness, so that you find freedom and peace and therefore also consonance (harmony) in
your inner world (consciousness) and in its firmaments (consciousness-levels), so you are no longer inhabitants
of the shadow world (hell) of evil in yourselves and you can henceforth also dwell in true love in yourselves.
43) And if you are knowing (conscious) in the truth and do good deeds from this, if you confirm (spread) true love
 and freedom as well as peace and consonance (harmony) in yourselves and outside yourselves amongst people
 of your kind (fellow human beings), then you do not burden yourselves and people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) above your and above their ability, so you find wellbeing in your inner world (consciousness) and in
 your psyche as inhabitants of your inner firmament (levels of consciousness) just as the inner firmaments (levels
 of consciousness) open for people of your kind (fellow human beings) and allow wellbeing to flood in.
44) Strive to sweep away everything that is in your thoughts and feelings in terms of resentment against people
 of your kind (next ones), and sweep away everything from in yourselves which burdens you through strife and
 jealousy, through hatred and pathological craving for revenge as well as through depravity, pathological crav-
 ing for retaliation and vice, as well as through avarice and pathological craving for recognition (ambition/mega-
 lomania) and all other terrible things; prize the true love and freedom in yourselves as well as the peace and
 consonance (harmony) so that you may be rightly led (guided); and truly, you can only find the right leader-
 ship (guidance) if you follow the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation); consider, that at all times the true prophets only brought to you the truth for you to follow, and
 never lies; call (say) to yourselves that the true prophets have given you the teaching of the truth, the teaching
 of the spirit, the teaching of the life as an inheritance for you to follow it and pass it on to your descendants
 and for your descendants to pass it on to their own descendants (children's children, etc.) in turn so that you
 and your descendants and their own descendants (children's children, etc.) are rewarded for what is effected
 through following the truth-teaching.
45) See, if you follow the truth-teaching then you are inhabitants of the firmament (delight) because you have
 found what the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) teach; but if you do not fol-
 low the truth-teaching then you are inhabitants of the shadow world (hell/dolefulness) because you cannot
 find what the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) teach; and because you can-
 not find the truth through your own blame since you are connected to the evil and unfairness (irresponsibility),
 and not connected to the truth, therefore you curse yourselves and turn yourselves into malefactors against
 the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation).
46) And those of you who are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and who
 are ones who curse the truth, you are at all times busily striving to make people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) turn away from the right way of the truth which you strive to make crooked so that those who are
 uncertain or wavering may fall victim to you.
47) Therefore there shall be a separation between you two, between the fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous
 ones (conscientious ones) and the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones),
 this separation taking such a form that it is apparent through the characteristics of consideration (kind of think -
 ing/attitude) which attitude (mentality) you are the child of; however irrespective of which attitude (mentality)
 you are the child of, respect one another nevertheless so that peace may prevail in you and with you so that
 you create the firmament of your inner world (consciousness) in goodness as you secretly hope it to be.
48) And if you meet one another and your eyes meet, then keep the peace amongst one another so that you do
 not kindle a fire of ruin between yourselves and do not commit outrages on one another (are not acting with
 Gewalt).
49) Truly, whether you are men or women who are attempting to reach heights of cognition and who recognise
 one another by the characteristics of your attitude (mentality), see to it that you are not arrogant (vain), but
 that you strive to it that your effort (endeavour) to obtain cognition regarding the truth bears good fruit.
 50) And if you follow the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, then you do not
 have to swear false vows, rather you can show benevolence to yourselves so that you create a paradise in your-
 selves and no fear of unright and no sorrow comes over you which you are unable to accept.
51) Do not be inhabitants of dread in your firmament of your inner self (nature) in which a fire of erosion burns
 so that you do not have to pour water (remorse) into the fire, so that you do not burn in your inequity (unfair-
 ness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness); verily, you must protect yourselves against the fire of inequity
 (unfairness) in you eating you up.
52) But if you take the knowledge of the truth as a pastime and as a game and allow yourselves to be seduced by
 mortal (earthly/material) life, then you are forgetting yourselves just as much as your unfolding (evolution) of
 your inner world (consciousness); and therefore you are forgetting the primal (creational) compulsions in your-
 selves to live according to the truth as you deny the signs (evidence) of the laws and recommendations of the
 wellspring of the love (Creation).
53) And truly, the true prophets bring you the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the
 life, in which their knowledge and their wisdom are explained, so that you may have a guideline (sign-posting/
 leading thought) from it and you may gain benevolence (humanity) in yourselves for yourselves and for people
 of your kind (fellow human beings) by accepting the teaching and understanding its explanations.
54) Do not wait for the warnings of the true prophets to be fulfilled if they predict warning things of the time to
 come (future), because on the day when the warning call of the prophets comes about it will be too late; do
 not be of the kind, that, when the predictions are fulfilled, you are obliged to say that you had forgotten the
 prior warnings of the true prophets and had lent your ear to the false prophets although in fact only the true
 prophets spoke the truth; truly, if you do not listen to the predictions of the true prophets and they fulfil them-
 selves then you will find no intercessors (attorneys) because you have suggestively and forcefully brought about
 calamity on yourselves; and truly, when the predicted events come to pass then you cannot turn back (wind
 back) time in order to undo everything, because it is through your foolishness (irrationality), which you cultivate,
 that you bring yourselves and the world to ruin, and everything that you present to yourselves as an illusion
 (fantasise) regarding gods and tin gods and other senseless things will leave you alone (let you down).
55) See, the only thing above you is the wellspring of the love (Creation) which created all firmaments (the universe),
 all lights in the sky (celestial bodies) and all earths (worlds/planets), and it placed you people of your kind
 (human beings) on the throne (above everything) so that you shall be keepers (guardians) over the appearance
 (nature), over all firmaments (the universe) and over all earths (worlds/planets), as well as over all kinds of life
 (life forms), both when the night conceals the day as well as when the day supersedes the night; and truly as
 everything is integrated into the wellspring of love (Creation), the sun, the moon and all earths (worlds/planets),
 the lights in the firmament (celestial bodies in the sky) and all kinds of life (life forms), so everything is under
 your guardianship for you to take care of it and protect everything in accordance with right, law and recom-
 mendation, because you have the loaned rule over it.
56) And truly, you are your own influence (dominance) over yourselves, therefore you shall uphold and honour it
 also and not fall into submissiveness and not pray to gods and tin gods, neither openly (visibly) nor in con-
 cealment, because otherwise you are misdoers against the truth which does not demand (ask for) any submis-
 siveness or worship.
57) And you are given the recommendation that you shall heed and honour the rules and regulations of the laws
 and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and shall not foment chaos on Earth, so that
 you do not have to call out for hope in fright for regulation to come about on Earth anew.
58) See, the appearance (nature) – which is created through the power of the laws and recommendations of the
 wellspring of the love (Creation) – carries winds ahead of it as a joyful message when the weather will be good,
 and it carries heavy clouds when rain is coming so that everything may thrive and the land be moistened if it
 is dry; and through the raining down of water, plants bring forth fruits of all kinds; and also the waters falling
 from the sky bring back secluded things (apparently dead things, i.e. withered things) back to life, just as also
 the spirit-body (spirit-form) will be reawakened (reborn) after the dying of people of your kind (human beings),
 together with a new individual being (personality) in a new body; may you be conscious of all this truth.
59) And the good land lets plants and vegetation grow and brings forth fruits in abundance, always in accordance
 with the laws of the primal power (Creation); but of those plants and vegetation that are bad for the good
 plants and vegetation, they thrive (grow) only meagrely, nevertheless you shall take care that they do not grow
 out of control and displace good plants and vegetation; therefore pay heed to the signs of the appearance
 (nature) so that you always do the right thing, so that you harvest good fruits and have sufficient provision
 (food).
60) And true prophets are sent to you from your midst so that you may hear the truth in all things and live right- fully, and also cultivate (till and plant) the land so that you do not have to fear the misery of hunger (famine).
61) But also be concerned that you do not have to suffer the misery of hunger (famine) if you breed a superfluity
 of descendants, therefore you shall not multiply like vermin; if you do however breed too many descendants
 then you are evidently acting in a mistaken wise because by doing so you invoke a calamity in great measure
 on yourselves, for your wellbeing (health) as well as for your world; and truly it is through your excessive de-
 scendants that you bring about great and worldwide battles (wars) and destruction, as well as hardship, misery,
 calamity and cataclysms in the extent of huge collapses (catastrophes) which you cannot set anything against,
 so you are helpless.
62) Be certain (knowing) that this will be the case if you do not do rightfully, because the true prophets do not
 foretell any erroneous assumptions, because they are the ones who know the time to come (future) and the
 time to come (farther future) and the time to come after the time to come (even farther future).
63) And the true prophets bring to you the message of what they have fathomed and learned about the laws and
 recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), and what they have learned from their foresight into
 the time to come (future), on the basis of which they give you sincere counsel, because they know many things
 that you do not know.
64) Therefore, do not be surprised that admonishments come to you through the true prophets who have arisen
 out of your midst, that they warn you and admonish you to be righteous (conscientious) and fair (responsible)
 and compassionate towards people of your kind (fellow human beings) and for all kinds of life (life forms), for
 the appearance (nature) and for your earth.
65) Therefore, do not accuse the true prophets of falseness (deviousness), because they want to save you from
 your inequity (unfairness) and unaccountability (consciencelessness) and virtuelessness, and truly they offer you
 an ark (boat of rescue) so that you may not drown in evil, in your lovelessness and unfreedom (bondage), but
 also in your dissonance (disharmony) and in unpeace, because you reject all signs (evidence) of the truth and
 truly smite yourselves with blindness.
66) Turn to the truth, because in the end you have no other way (possibility), because your ultimate destination is defined in the unfolding (evolution) of your inner world (consciousness), if only you would comprehend this.
67) Do not be ones unknowing of the truth as individuals and as a people, like your heads (authorities/mightful
 ones/governing ones) are ones unknowing of the truth, so you are not prejudiced in foolishness (irrationality)
 like them and so you do not consider the true prophets to be liars, so that you also do not, in submissiveness,
 fall prey to lying before people of your kind (human beings) and before gods and tin gods and false prophets,
 priests and other servants (hands/helpers).
68) Know that there is no foolishness (irrationality) in the true prophets, but rather they are out of their own initia-
 tive proclaimers of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation).
69) The true prophets bring you the message of the truth, and they are your sincere and true counsellors.
70) Do not be surprised that they come to you to give you an admonition when they state to you your time to come (future), which you are willing to terribly run into in your undiscernment (unintellect); and do not be sur-
prised that the true prophets come from your midst and have more knowledge and wisdom than you, but con-
sider that they have determined (selected) themselves to do this and therefore they have also fathomed and
learned the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and of its appearance (nature),
so that they warn you about what will happen if you do not follow the teaching of the truth, the teaching of
the spirit, the teaching of the life and thereby create a disaster; and think of the time of your existence (life)
which you shall use to become knowing (conscious) and wise so that you may manage the inheritance that has
been benignly (benevolently) given to you as Earth and each kind of life (life form) as well as all firmaments (the
universe) and as earths (worlds/planets) and lights in the firmament (celestial bodies), so you are put in place
as their guardians (protectors); and consider the constitution of your body which enables you to stand above
all animals and above all creatures so that you may intentionally (consciously) unfold (evolve) in your inner
world (consciousness), something which is only possible to you alone as people of your kind (human beings).
71) And the true prophets come to you so that you may meet the wellspring of the love (Creation), and everything
 that it has created, in veneration (deference), and not worship and pray to gods and tin gods or people of your
 kind (human beings); and truly you shall not worship and shall not pray to people of your kind (human beings)
 but, if they are worthy of it, you shall only show them deference as well as esteem and dignity; and consider
 that the true prophets indeed bring you admonishments and the truth-teaching, because they are truthful, but
 they do not bring you anything with which they threaten you, because if terrible things threaten you then you
 yourselves create threats in the wise that you do things which are wrong, by means of which the threats are ful-
 filled.
72) True prophets have never brought down punishment or rage on you, they also do not dispute with you about the truth and its name (the outstanding) as you do this and as your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/
forebears) did it, although they had not received authority to do this from anywhere, just as you have not
either; and because you do this, you remain amongst the waiting ones (ones unknowing of the truth) until you bethink yourselves and you turn to the truth.
73) The true prophets are attempting with their teaching of the truth, their teaching of the spirit, their teaching of
 the life to rescue you in benevolence (humanity) from all the harm, the misery and the hardship and from every-
 thing that you bring about deliberately and unfairly as well as unrighteously (in consciencelessness) in virtue-
 lessness through lacking the knowledge of the truth, but you cut off the last twigs and branches from the tree
 on which you are sitting, because you repudiate the signs (evidence) of the truth and are unknowing in the
 truth.
74) Truly, turn to the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), and also to the laws and
 recommendations of its appearance (nature), because apart from these laws and recommendations there are
 no others through which all of the existence (life) with regard to the condition (cause) and decision (effect =
 cause and effect) would be determined; truly, right from the very start of your existence, clear signs (evidence)
 of the truth of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and its decision (nature), as well as of its laws and recom-
 mendations, have come to you so that you may recognise (see) them and follow the truth; therefore allow
 yourselves to be instructed (taught) in the truth so that you may follow all love-power (the creational) and you
 do not bring about any harm to yourselves, as you do not have to suffer anything painful in yourselves.
75) And consider the earth on which you are dwelling and which is given to you benignly (benevolently) as an in- heritance so that you may build your dwellings and palaces upon its plains or so you can dig them into the
mountains in order to be protected against the weather (elements); do rightfully in these things and do not
rob land from one another, neither the plains nor the mountains nor the dwelling places, but do rightly and
fairly in all things so that you do not commit any unright whatsoever on Earth and do not foment any chaos.
76) And therefore do not elect arrogant (vain ones) and godly (religious/sectarian) heads (authorities/rulers/might-
 ful ones) for your peoples, because they are weak and are believers in gods and tin gods, for which reason
 they issue evil laws and bring about (incite) battles (wars) through which many people of your kind (human
 beings) are killed (murdered) and also great destruction is brought about, quite apart from the fact that such
 heads (authorities/rulers and mightful ones) are responsible for much hardship and misery, unfreedom (bondage),
 unpeace and dissonance (disharmony); be certain (knowing) that they are delegates of their own evil in them-
 selves and that they truly do not accept the truth which is brought to them by the prophets.
77) The arrogant (vain) and godly (religious/sectarian) heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) of your peoples do
 not care themselves about the truth and equitableness (fairness) either, nor do they care themselves about
 righteousness (conscientiousness), peace, freedom and consonance (harmony) in the people and for the
 people, as it is in the nature of those heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) to raise themselves up into their
 area (position) through outrage (Gewalt/murder/crimes/bribery), etc.
78) And these heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) defy your desires with commands of Gewalt (terror) which
 they instruct to be carried out upon you by their henchmen, and they threaten horrible things to you if you fail
 to follow their commands which are meted out by their envoys; therefore they have you tormented (tortured)
 or killed if you act contrary to what they are demanding from you in inequity (unfairness).
79) And if you are struck by an earthquake such that you are stretched out on the ground (dead) in your dwellings
 in the morning, then they instruct their henchmen to rob you even in death so that they can enrich themselves
 with your possessions, as is also done by many unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), unfair ones (irrespon-
 sible ones) and virtueless ones who belong to godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) and
 undertake robbing of corpses (body stripping), which is something that ones knowing of the truth, righteous
 ones (conscientious ones), fair ones (responsible ones) and virtuous ones never do.
80) Do not follow these unfair ones (irresponsible ones), unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and virtueless
 ones, rather follow the truth-teaching which is brought to you by the true prophets as a message of the laws
 and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation); this message alone offers you sincere counsel
 and shows you the way for leading (guiding) existence (life), therefore you shall listen to the sincere counsel
 that the prophets give to you as true counsellors.
81) Follow the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life so that you do not commit
 any infamous actions (crimes) and are not worse and do not commit even more despicable actions, such as no-
 one before you in the world has committed.
82) Do not be excessive in your mode of the life and do not engage in desires (vice/wantonness/pathological crav- ings/urges); and if you have congress (sexual intercourse) as a man with a man, or as a woman with a woman,
or man and woman together then keep discipline over yourselves (self-control) so that you do what is rightful.
83) And always be a people and of one sense for progression (progress) and prosperousness (success), as well as with regard to upholding the peace and everything that is good and of value; and never drive people of your
kind (fellow human beings) out of your houses, hamlets (villages) or cities through hatred or jealousy, through
unpeace, revenge, retaliation or for any other reasons of unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and inequity (unfairness), but keep yourselves clean (free) from such activities.
84) And if strangers come to you from other peoples and search for protection with you, then take them in, pro-
 vide for (feed and clothe) them and offer them safety and activity (work) if they can show (prove) that they are
 persecuted and their body and life have been threatened; also, do not leave those behind (leave helpless) who
 are able to show (prove) that they need your help.
85) Provide for (feed and clothe) those who give you signs (evidence) of their poverty (need) so that things may be
 fair to them and you, and so that no powerful rain of disgust (inhumanity) may sweep down over you which
 will drown you in shame and guilt, such that you find a miserable end in the estimation of people of your kind
 (fellow human beings).
86) Truly, kindheartedness and beneficence towards people of your kind (fellow human beings) is a clear sign (evi-
 dence) of your dignity and puts you on a par with benevolence (humanity); therefore give at all time in full
 measure (ampleness/sufficiency) and full weight (extent) and do not reduce the belongings (possessions) of
 people of your kind (fellow human beings), just as you shall not foment chaos on Earth or unpeace amongst
 people of your kind (human beings); keep your world in all things in regulation so that you do not destroy it
 and your space (dwelling space).
87) And do not threateningly lie in wait on each way for people of your kind (fellow human beings) because you
 want to make those turn away from the way of the truth who are striving for the truth and fulfilment of the
 laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation); do not try to make their way crooked (to
 lead them away from the way), and remember that through your wrong doings you increase the calamity in
 yourselves and you will be befallen by unpleasant things if you foment chaos and unpeace and lead those away
 from the right way who are searching for the truth.
88) There are some amongst you who believe that the true prophets are envoys of a good god or tin god, and
 others who believe that they are envoys of the evil one (devil) of all abysses (hell), but whatever you believe,
 you are wrong in your belief (assumptions), because there are neither gods nor tin gods, nor evil as an individ-
 ual being (devil as person/Wesenheit); however exercise patience and learn so that you experience the truth
 and are able to decide between it and your belief (assumptions), because you alone are the true determiners
 over whether you want to open your ears to the truth or to the untruth.
89) And as you yourselves must decide between the truth and untruth, the same must also be done by your heads
 (authorities/rulers/mightful ones); even if they still want to deny the truth and drive it out (eradicate it) in order
 to wallow in their own might; and therefore they secretly foment unpeace and resistance amongst you (in the
 people) against the true prophets so that you drive them out of your hamlets (villages) and cities and chase
 them across the country, so you return to your avowal (belief) in gods and tin gods and in your heads (authori-
 ties/rulers/mightful ones), also then if you do not have the volition to do this, in which case they then wreak
 Gewalt (terror) on you.
90) And like those amongst you who fabulate (invent) your lies against the truth and against the true prophets,
 your heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) do the same as people of your kind (as you), so you are not res-
 cued by the truth which would make things fine in your existence (life), instead you are subjugated through
 the lie of the untruth and the heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) who maliciously exploit you and coerce
 you into hatred and pathological craving for revenge and pathological craving for retaliation, so that they can
 misuse you for battles (wars) and destruction and you become manslayers (murderers); and also the false prophets
 teach you the same thing and lie saying that it is not seemly for you to lend your ear to the true prophets or
 not to return to the belief in gods and tin gods and the heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones); and the false
 prophets have the audacity to lie – as do your heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) – that it is the gods and
 tin gods who want everything according to their will and that their knowledge encompasses all things which
 is why you should place your trust in them, therefore you shall decide between them and the teaching of the
 prophets, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life; therefore, however, they
 say you should decide according to their sense, according to what they want, so that you are not the ones who
 take the decision but rather them, the false prophets and heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones).
91) Your heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) who believe in gods and tin gods, and your false prophets who are truly no prophets, and their priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of gods and tin gods lead you into
servitude (bondage) and into the truth-unknowledge and they lie that you are the lost ones if you follow the
truth-teaching of the true prophets; truly, they misuse you as slaves for their dark purposes (plans) so that they
may exploit and deceive you through teachings of the lie; and they lie that it has been commanded by gods
and tin gods for you to exert punishment on fallible ones and that you shall harm their body and life and their
psyche and their inner life (consciousness); and they also lie that the gods and tin gods have commanded that
you must wage battles (war) and kill (murder) and destroy by falling upon your next ones, people of your kind
(fellow human beings) and other peoples with pillage, robbery, defilement (violation) and bloodthirstiness
(killing) and mete out evil revenge and retaliation in hatred, or that you commit outrages (acts of Gewalt/tor- ture/murder, etc.) in voracity for the riches of Earth (resources/mineral deposits) and for land and water; but truly, if you follow these false teachings of false prophets and of your heads (authorities/rulers/mightful ones) then you are lost to the truth, because the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and of its appearance (nature) only teach true love and freedom for every kind of life form (life form), as well as peace and consonance (harmony), and in no wise the opposite.
92) And truly, if you follow the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life then you
 are following the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and of its appearance
 (nature), whereas those amongst you who follow the false teaching of the false prophets cast yourselves
 downwards into the darkness of your unknowledge of the truth, so that on the morning of cognition (when
 you recognise the truth) it is as if you are struck by an earthquake and are stretched out on the ground in
 shame (shaken down to the ground).
93) As you are attached to the false prophets and denounce the true prophets of lying, so you take the truth away
 from yourselves (make the truth a stranger to yourselves), so you make yourselves into lost ones and fall into
 delusion.
94) Therefore turn away from the false prophets and from their gods and tin gods so that you connect yourselves
 with the message of the truth and may find sincere counsel with the true prophets who do not sadden you as
 the false prophets do and the priests and other servants (hands/helpers) of gods and tin gods who lead you
 into delusion and make you beg and supplicate for help and goodness, for which you never receive any pre-
 mium (gain/benefit).
95) Wherever false prophets appear, you as inhabitants of Earth, your hamlets (villages) and cities and everywhere
 are befallen by hardship and misery and by tribulation, battle (war), punishment and death and destruction
 due to their false teachings of the lie, because truthly they humiliate you and demand that you prostrate your-
 selves before their gods and tin gods and bloodthirsty (murderous) laws, as also do false heads (authorities/
 rulers/mightful ones) and priests as well as other servants of gods and servants of tin gods who bewitch you
 with their belief (assumptions) and rob you of your own freedom (autonomy), peace, love and consonance (har-
 mony).
96) Take your terrible state (condition) of belief in godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) as well as
 in false prophets and false heads (authorities/ruler/mightful ones) and change it into a good state (condition)
 so that you may gain a great wealth of truthly knowledge and wisdom and love, as well as of your own inner
 freedom and peace and consonance (harmony), so you switch from sorrow to joy and you are unexpectedly
 seized by happiness.
97) If you are righteous (conscientious) and you strive for the truth of the laws and recommendations of the well-
 spring of the love (Creation), then fruitfulnesses (wellbeing) will be opened to you by your firmament (con-
 sciousness) and your earth (psyche) which will exceed all your wishes; but if you are unrighteous (conscience-
 less) and you do not strive then you will persist in the state (condition) of inner misery and inner hardship,
 because you realise (create) in yourselves what you acquire through what you do and how you guide your
 thoughts and feelings.
98) Do right at all times and do not fear the truth so that you are not inhabitants of your own inequity (unfairness)
 and unrighteousness (consciencelessness), so that you do not create punishment in yourselves which comes
 (breaks in) over you in the daytime whilst you are awake or at night when you are sleeping.
99) And do not be inhabitants of your own state (condition) of evil in yourselves, so that no punishment comes
 (breaks in) over you from out of yourselves neither in the day nor at night, nor in the early hours of the morn-
 ing, nor in the early hours of the evening, not in the morning and not in the afternoon, neither when you are
 working or playing or taking enjoyment.
100) Never be sure in the face of evil and of the deceiving intentions (purposes) of the false prophets, because you
 can never feel secure when confronted by them, since they condemn you to downfall (unsatisfaction) through
 their lies and false teachings just like the priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods do in order
 to enslave you (place you in bondage) and exploit you, so that they can lead a life in pathological craving for
 admiration (pathological craving for glory/conceitedness/vanity) and in debauchery.
101) The laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) are a leadership (guidance) for you
 who, as inhabitants, have Earth as an inheritance in your care (trust) so that you are pleasing (beneficial) to
 Earth and do the best for it, so that you do not defile (curtail) it and its appearance (nature) and you maintain
 all kinds of life (life forms) so that your world may be a place of joyful living (paradise) for you.
102) The true prophets also come to you indeed to show clear signs (evidence) that Earth is also a life form which requires your protection and your keeping (care), therefore you shall take care for it and shall be favourable to
it; if you however declare this message of the prophets to be a lie and you seal (close) your attitude towards
harming (disadvantaging) your earth, then it will sicken in its appearance (nature), so that heavy gales and
storms and upheavals and convulsions (catastrophes) will come over your world and over you, which you will no longer be able to master.
103) See therefore that you find the truth and follow the teaching of the prophets so that you hold fast to the bond (agreement) with the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), and you
do not find yourselves as malefactors against (destroyers of) the appearance (nature) and against the earth.
104) And truly, since time immemorial you have condemned the signs (evidence) that the true prophets bring to
 you, as you are outrageous (dismissive and destructive) against them because you do not want to know the
 truth, but want to wallow in your Ausartungen of all kinds; but if you do not observe the signs (evidence and
 teaching) of the prophets and the signs of the time that they reveal to you then you are fomenting chaos in
 your world so it will suffer and be destroyed by this as you also cause suffering and harm to yourselves and
 you ruin your own gains (achievements).
105) Therefore open your ears and your eyes to the signs (evidence) that the true prophets bring to you so that you
 may use it for your advantage and may have an existence (life) in pleasure.
106) Truly, it is not seemly for the true prophets to speak other than the truth about the truth, therefore when they
 come to you they only bring clear signs (evidence) and speak clear words; thus allow those who are connected
 to the truth to go with the prophets and do not persecute them, because consider that you too at your time
 will also become knowing (conscious) of the truth and will not want to be persecuted by the unfair ones (ir-
 responsible ones), the ones unknowing of the truth and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones).
107) And if you belong to the undisguised ones (truthful ones/truth-loving ones) and you are able to interpret and
 to understand the signs (evidence) of the prophets and of the appearance (nature) of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation), then show (teach) them to your next ones and to all those people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) who want to gain knowledge of them and to be connected to the teaching of the truth, the teaching
 of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
108) And if you are connected to the truth, then let it be in strength and not like a weak stick which breaks when
 it is bent, and be as watchful as a snake which does not want to be trodden underfoot but which can, how-
 ever, defend itself if it is attacked; so shall you be in your knowledge and in your steadfastness about the truth,
 exactly like a strong and unbreakable rod and like a heedful snake so that you recognise when you are being
 attacked and you can defend yourselves according to right and the law without having contempt for the laws
 and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), so that you do rightfully in all cases.
109) And heed that if you defend yourselves, that your hands are white (not besmirched through acts of Gewalt)
 so that all viewers (observers) of your deeds may see that you are protecting yourselves rightfully; and only use
 means for your defence which only serve in defence (self-defence), but not however for killing, so that you do
 not make yourselves guilty of manslaughter or of blood guilt (murder) and be called to take account (respon-
 sibility).
110) And heed that you do not deceive or steal from people of your kind (fellow human beings), neither openly
 (publicly) nor in secret, nor with activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic/legerdemain/tricks) so
 that you are not accused of committing evil (devilish things) or the black arts (suggestive trickery).
111) And heed that you do not commit unright in any wise whatsoever, so that you are not driven from your dwell- ing places and not out of your land; and heed the wise counsel (advice): «Do right and dread no-one.»
112) Restrain your unrightful doings and do not listen to summoners (bailiffs) of the heads (authorities/rulers/ might-
 ful ones) and the false prophet as well as the priests and servants of gods and servants of tin gods of the god-
 linesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) who take you prisoner in contravention of what is rightful
 and accuse (denounce) you of activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic), so that you shall be co-
 erced into becoming unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and believers
 in gods and tin gods.
113) And do not allow yourselves to be ensnared through wealth and possessions which are offered to you as a
 reward if you give up the truth, because the summoners (bailiffs) of the godlinesses (religions) and sub-godli-
 nesses (sects/cults) only want to reward you so that they may prevail over you.
114) They only want you to belong to those who are like them (the same as them) so that they may increase their
 throng through you and cause all kinds of calamity and be able to commit outrages (crimes) without being
 brought to account for them.
115) Therefore, do not belong to those who are their own next ones in inequity (unfairness) and unaccountability
 (consciencelessness) because they only see and love themselves, yet only use ones like them (ones the same as
 them) for pursuing their shameful (criminal) ends.
116) Be always watchful so that you may first cast far from you whatever is evil and unfair (irresponsible) before the
 unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) can lull you into evil and unfair-
 ness (irresponsibility).
117) Cast far away from you all evil and unfairness (irresponsibility) so that you will not be spellbound and so you
 are righteous (conscientious) in the eyes of people of your kind (fellow human beings), so that you do not have
 to go in fear of them and do not have to bring forth lies and enormous hallucinations (magic) in order to be
 recognised by them as fair ones (responsible ones).
118) Be at all times as strong as an unbreakable rod so that you do not consume evil and unfairness (irresponsibility)
 and do not make these things to your food, but regard evil and unfairness (irresponsibility) as delusiveness
 which brings about all terrible things.
119) Be fair and connected to the real truth so that you recognise that all unrightful deeds are insidiousness and malice (contemptibility) against the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation).
120) Therefore be ashamed and turn away from evil and unfairness (irresponsibility), from the unrighteous (con-
 scienceless) and from virtuelessness so that you are no longer overcome by unright.
121) Do not allow the hallucinations (magic) of the false prophets, the priests and other servants of gods and serv- ants of tin gods to coerce you into praying to fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, rather recognise your-
selves and the truth, that you are created creations (life forms) of the sole wellspring of the love (Creation).
122) Be aware (conscious) that solely the wellspring of the love (Creation) is the might over all firmaments (the uni-
 verse) and over all earths (worlds/planets), as well as over all lights in the firmament (celestial bodies/comets,
 etc.), over all kinds of life (life forms), over all existence and over everything that crawls and flies.
123) Since time immemorial you have believed in the false prophets who deceive you with cunning and have de-
 vised (hatched/invented) evil against you, so that you have been led away by them from the search for the
 truth, therefore you are experiencing bad consequences of your doings up to the present day.
124) Truly, through the false teaching of the false prophets, you have invented outrageous (criminal) laws in order
 to discipline and to punish people of your kind (fellow human beings) by causing pain (torture) on them and
 defiling (cutting) their trunk (body) and their limbs (extremities) and committing bloody deeds (murder) on
 them as punishment and practising barbarity (inhumanity); if you do the same then you are acting against the
 laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), because they do not allow you to discipline
 and cause pain (torture) to people of your kind (fellow human beings), to cut off their hands and feet and cru-
 cify them, stone them, strangle them or cut off their head; truly, the false prophets do not teach you the laws
 and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), but rather what is hellish (devilish), demonic
 and cruel, so that you shall be heinous (depraved) and fall prey to depravation.
125) Turn away from your villainy and see that you find the way to the truth of the laws and recommendations of
 the wellspring of the love (Creation) so that you are fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscien-
 tious ones) and live in virtuousness, so that you no longer follow the false laws of the false prophets, but rather
 are fair to the dignity of people of your kind (being human in the real and true sense).
126) Do not mete out revenge or retaliation on people of your kind (fellow human beings) if they turn to the signs
 (evidence) of the truth and live according to the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation), rather pour steadfastness into them so that they may continue to live in the truth and will one day
 die as ones knowing of the truth when their time has come.
127) Do not allow yourselves to foment chaos in the land and amongst the people, or that you turn to gods and
 tin gods as well as to the false prophets, priests and other servants of gods and servants of tin gods; truly, you
 have Gewalt over yourselves in order to do goodness and to turn to the truth and the laws and recommenda-
 tions of the wellspring of the love (Creation), if you are only willing to do so; and as you shall bind yourselves
 to the truth, so you shall not kill, neither your enemies nor your sons and daughters, just as you as man and
 woman shall not kill one another; Gewalt is given to you over life and death so that you may protect life and
 prevent death, so that it only takes possession of you and people of your kind (fellow human beings) on the
 way of the natural, because truly you shall not kill people of your kind (human beings) but rather save yourselves
 from death and Gewalt (terror).
128) Search at all times for help and guidance in the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation) and be steadfast in the knowledge and in the wisdom of the truth; truly, it is only in the laws and
 recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) that you will find the guideline (leading thought) of
 existence (life) so that you may honour life and avoid death in Ausartung, so that it only comes to you natu-
 rally; thus life is bequeathed (given) to you by the wellspring of the love (Creation), as well as death, but in
 such a wise that you make life worth living in order to avoid death until the way of the natural comes to an
 end and death calls you yourselves because you have completed the time of the life.
129) Do not create any enmity with other peoples and neither amongst people of your kind (next ones and fellow
 human beings) so that you do not suffer persecution by the enemies who want to eliminate you; and conduct
 yourselves with dignity and righteousness (conscientiousness), equitableness (fairness) and virtuousness, so no
 others raise themselves up over you as rulers and are able to steal your dwelling places and your land.
130) And cultivate your land and the whole Earth without tormenting and destroying it, and be admonished to do
 this because otherwise it will raise itself up against you and bring you unweather, high waters, enormous
 storms, fire and drought, as well as dearths of fruits and other provision (food).
131) See that only good comes to you from Earth, as it will be and as it is due to you (as you are entitled to) when
 you strive for it; do at all times rightfully with your world so that no calamity comes (breaks in) over you from
 it for which you yourselves are to blame; consider that if calamity comes (breaks in) over you that you alone
 are to blame for it, even if most of you do not know it, because you do not care about the laws of condition
 (cause) and of decision (effect = cause and effect).
132) See the signs of your appearance (nature) and allow yourselves to be captivated (influenced) by them so that
 you recognise that the earth with its laws of its appearance (nature) will not submit to you, but that you must
 fall in line with it (integrate yourselves) in order to spend your existence (life) in togetherness with it, and to
 obtain (draw) the best gains (effects) from it.
133) Therefore consider: Whatever you do with your earth, it will never submit to you.
134) And be certain (knowing) that if you do not do rightfully with your world and with all people of your kind
 (humankind) then grievances (vexations) will come over you, such as great storms and high waters, and you
 will be oppressed (plagued) by locusts, by lice and frogs, as well as by scourges (plagues) and vermin and many
 kinds of life (life forms) and people of your kind (human beings) who change into deformed ones (mutated
 ones) for which you are to blame and spread torment; therefore do not be arrogant (vain) and do not commit
 outrages (misdemeanours) against the appearance (nature) or against the laws and recommendations of the
 wellspring of the love (Creation) so that no calamity comes over you.
135) Do not bring about judgement on yourselves through your earth and its appearance (nature), but in all your
 doings be based on the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life which prom-
 ises you goodness and wellbeing if you free yourselves from evil and unfairness (irresponsibility) and from
 unrighteousness (consciencelessness) as well as from unknowledge of the truth.
136) Do not put off the time for turning to the truth so that you do not become a victim of your own punishment
 that you carry out and complete on yourselves when you recognise that through a promise of a bond (agree-
 ment) with the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) you could have
 been able to lead a better life, which had not been given through your own blame.
137) Do not mete out revenge and retaliation on people of your kind (fellow human beings) if they have done bad
 things to you, but heed love and forgiveness so that you are truly people of your kind (human beings); do not
 allow people of your kind (fellow human beings) to drown in the sea or in other bodies of water or to lie in
 misery if they are in need, just so that you can mete out revenge and retaliation on them; and do not mete
 out revenge and retaliation on people of your kind (fellow human beings) because they treat the signs (evi-
 dence) of the truth as lies or because they do not heed your honour and dignity, because they do it out of
 unintellect (dumbness) and because they do not know what they are doing.
138) And give help to people of your kind (fellow human beings) if they are weak because the help is given to you
 as an inheritance and a boon (prosperousness) through the wellspring of the love (Creation) so that you may
 pass it on to people of your kind (fellow human beings) and all kinds of life (life forms) when they have need
 of it; therefore be full of kindheartedness to people of your kind (human beings) and to all kinds of life (life
 forms) and always find friendly and forgiving words for them so that you fulfil the laws of the feelings for
 others and provide steadfastness to those who need it; give them power and confidence for their existence
 (life) so that they do not destroy everything that they have built and created.
139) Do not leave your country and also do not take a ship over the sea and go to another land in order to go to
 a people that is devoted to gods or tin gods; and do not go there in order to do the same as them, so that
 you do not pray to gods and tins gods and you do not fall prey to the untruth.
140) And do not bear hatred towards people of your kind (next ones) and appreciate their good deeds and every-
 thing that they have created of goodness, therefore you shall not go there and you shall not cast into ruin the
 gains (achievements) that they have laboriously created; do not be conceited (arrogant) or obsessed by the
 things of people of your kind (next ones) that they have created, so that you do not desire them in an unright-
 ful wise and you do not appropriate them for yourselves in an unrightful wise.
141) Consider that you shall not be raised above your desires (standing above your own wishes), but that you shall
 proceed in modesty and not demand the gain (achievement) of people of your kind (next ones), neither their
 possessions and wealth nor their woman or man.
142) Consider the time that bitter torment can oppress you if you yourselves are robbed of your possessions or
 wealth or your woman or man or if your gains (achievements) are stolen from you.
143) The laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) have given you a promise that you will
 live in joy and prosperity until your end if you do rightfully and fulfil the laws and recommendations to the best
 of your ability; and as you do rightfully and fulfil the laws and recommendations to the best of your ability, not
 fomenting any chaos, guiding yourselves and people of your kind (fellow human beings) rightly and honouring
 and rightly treating your earth, then you have the life of joy (paradise) on Earth.
 144) Do not be presumptuous and do not dare to want to see the wellspring of the love (Creation) in its spirit-en-
 ergy, because as an unmeasurable secret it exists so high above you that you would perish if you could view
 (see) its spirit-energy, but you can never behold it in this wise; but see that the wellspring of the love (Creation)
 is ubiquitous and in all and everything, so you merely have to look at everything that you can see with your
 eyes, the firmaments (universe), the earths (worlds/planets), the lights in the firmament (celestial bodies and
 comets, etc.), the appearance (nature) and all kinds of life (life forms), as well as people of your kind (human
 beings) and everything that crawls and flies, because the wellspring of the love (Creation) breathes in everything,
 because it is present in everything.
145) All of you people of your kind (human beings), you have been selected by the wellspring of the love (Creation)
 as its highest created kind of life (life form) to look after Earth, the firmaments (universe), the earths (worlds/
 planets), the lights in the firmament (celestial bodies and comets, etc.), as well as being the guardians (protec-
 tors) of them and all kinds of life (life forms), therefore you shall take and look after everything in this wise just
 as you shall be connected to the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and it
 itself in gratitude for this.
146) Always remember the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and the teaching of
 the prophets, through which you are admonished and find explanations in all things, so you shall hold fast to
 it and make the best of it in all respects, so that you are not malefactors (lawbreakers) against the truth.
147) Consider that if you conduct yourselves arrogantly (vainly) against the truth of the laws and recommendations
 of the wellspring of the love (Creation), and if you are against all right and against the accountability, then al -
 though you can see the signs (evidence) of the wellspring of the love (Creation) in its appearance (nature) and
 all around in the firmaments (universe) and on the earths (worlds/planets), as well as in the lights of the firma-
 ment (celestial bodies/comets) and in all kinds of life (life forms), in people of your kind (human beings) and in
 everything that crawls and flies, you nevertheless cannot recognise (see) the signs (evidence) as such and neither
 can you understand them because you do not live according to the truth and you do not know it either; and
 if you are shown the way of the truth and also see the way of fairness (responsibility) and of accountability,
 then you do not want to accept it or to walk upon it, but continue along the way of erroneous assumption
 which you have made your own, because you treat the signs (evidence) of the wellspring of the love (Creation)
 as a lie and do not heed them.
148) And those amongst you who do not heed the signs (evidence) of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and do
 not heed the truth – your deeds are arrogant (vain) and are not steadfast, and therefore you cannot be rewarded
 for goodness, but instead you can only receive a poor reward for what you do that is lacking goodness.
149) And do not make yourselves gods and tin gods out of gold and pieces of jewellery, neither from wood or from
 stone or from metal or anything else, because they are only lifeless insubstantialities which cannot bring forth
 any sound, because truly you shall be connected only to the truth of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and
 its laws and recommendations, through which you are led (guided) onto the right way and which do not
 demand any worship from you, so that you are not malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth.
150) Truly, it is only rightful for you to be seized by remorse for what you do that is disgraceful (criminal) to the truth;
 recognise that you are truly going into delusion and are doing unright, so that you may give yourselves right-
 ful instruction (teaching) and have pity for yourselves and forgive yourselves so that you are not lost ones who
 wallow in the untruth.
151) Be worried (concerned) if you take the way of falsehood and perpetrate evil, because you are in a rush to con- coct (hatch) a way for yourselves that should bring you quickly to possessions and wealth, because truly only
your worries (concern) about your evil striving and about your evil deeds can prevent you from doing what is
unrightful, so that enemies do not rejoice over you and cannot rightfully accuse (blame) you of misdeeds.
152) Be worried (concerned) if unrighteous (conscienceless) and unfair (irresponsible) and virtueless thoughts and
 feelings befall you, so you grant yourselves access to your own equitableness (fairness) and righteousness
 (conscientiousness) and virtuousness and you are your own giver of compassion.
153) However, do not pray to yourselves so that you do not become arrogant (vain) to yourselves and you do not
 bring down upon yourselves rage and ignominy from people of your kind (fellow human beings); and lead your
 life here below in deference (honourableness) so that no others can fabulate (invent) lies and slanders (calum-
 nies) against you which harm you; however, if they do invent lies and slanders (calumnies) against you if you
 are not arrogant (vain) and if you direct (maintain) your existence (life) in modesty, righteousness (conscien-
 tiousness), virtues and equitableness (fairness) then the lies and slanders (calumnies) will turn to your advan-
 tage and benefit (success) and become a disadvantage (detriment/harm) and a uselessness to the liars and slan-
 derers (calumniators).
154) If you do evil and commit unfairness (irresponsibility), unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and virtuelessness then people of your kind (fellow human beings) will forgive you in the same wise as you can forgive yourselves
if you feel sorry in uprightness and in openness (honesty) and you visibly (obviously) and recognisably change to the better.
155) And do not allow rage to rise up in you, but calm yourselves down if you become agitated, because you re-
 quire your own leadership (guidance) in calmness (equanimity) so that you are afraid of what shameful (villain-
 ous) things you could do in rage.
156) Choose yourselves as righteous ones (conscientious ones) and fair ones (responsible ones) and do not set any
 delay in doing so, rather make the change in the moment (immediately) so that you no longer do unrighteous
 things (conscienceless things) and unfair things (irresponsible things); eradicate everything in you that cannot
 be brought into agreement with the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation), and do it for the sake of being righteous ones (conscientious ones), fair ones (responsible ones) and
 virtuous ones, so that you withstand each temptation and you no longer fall into calamity; be your own pro-
 tectors, take pity on yourselves and forgive yourselves, because you are the best forgivers if you are sincerely
 remorseful and you free yourselves from all unright and all unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and inequity
 (unfairness).
157) Determine goodness for yourselves in this world and turn honestly and remorsefully to the truth of the laws
 and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), so that no punishment whatsoever may strike
 you because of yourselves or people of your kind (human beings), but rather that you may be surrounded by
 an all-embracing feeling of good protection as is given to all things when what is done is done rightfully, as is
 determined by the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation).
158) And if you follow the true prophets then you direct yourselves according to what is right and avoid unright, as
 is recommended to you through the recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation); and the recom-
 mendations recommend that you shall only allow yourselves good things, but deny yourselves bad things so
 that everything may vanish from you that places a burden upon you and which keeps you in chains, which
 makes you captives of your own selves; and if you open your ears to the word of your true prophets and make
 their teaching into your knowledge and your wisdom, thereby honouring the prophets in their duty (mission/
 obligation) and strengthening them and helping them and following the light (clarity of teaching) that they
 spread, then things will be fine with you.
159) All you people of your kind (humankind), truly, your true prophets are the light (sign-post) on your world, and therefore they are the pioneers that you may one day understand the firmaments (universe) and the earths
(worlds/planets), the lights in the firmaments (celestial bodies and comets, etc.) as well as the kinds of life (life
forms) and people of your kind (human beings); and they teach you that the appearance (nature) and the laws
and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) give life and let it die again in order to reawaken
it through the power of the spirit-body (spirit-form); therefore you are recommended to open your ears to the
true prophets and their teaching and their words, and to follow them so that you may be rightly led (guided).
160) All people of your kind (humankind), be a unity (community) in which you admonish yourselves through the
 teaching of the prophets to the truth, according to its laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love
 (Creation), its equitableness (fairness), righteousness (conscientiousness) and sincerity, as well as virtuousness
 and love.
161) Although you are divided into tribes and peoples, you are still a unity (community) as all people of your kind
 (humankind), therefore you shall not rise up against one another with hatred, battle (war), revenge and retri-
 bution so that peace and freedom, as well as consonance (harmony) may prevail amongst you, as is recom-
 mended to you through the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), therefore you
 shall not commit misdemeanours (infringements) against it.
162) Live as a great community of people of your kind (humankind) in true peace, in love, freedom and in conso-
 nance (harmony) on Earth, do good things for one another and create assuagement from all your burden; and
 do not allow yourselves to be driven through the gate of submissiveness by people of your kind (human beings)
 or by fabulated (invented) gods, tin gods and demons when priests and other servants of gods, servants of tin
 gods and servants of demons promise you salvation (redemption) and forgiveness for your missteps (vices/
 blame/unvirtues/offences), vices, blames and unvirtues, because truly their promises are only lies and power-
 less words because they do not have the might to liberate you from your missteps, blames, vices and virtue -
 lessnesses; only you yourselves can forgive yourselves if you sincerely feel sorry for your unrightful deeds and
 henceforth do good deeds and continuously increase the number of good deeds.
163) Do not be unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and do not confuse the word of the truth with words of the untruth
 when you speak with people of your kind (fellow human beings) so that you do not charge yourselves with
 lying and no shame comes over you as judgement from those to whom you twist the words of the truth into
 words of the untruth (calumny); do not be outrageous (presumptuous) with your words, but always use them
 carefully and decently so that you cannot be charged with impoliteness (boorishness).
164) And do not defile your honour and dignity by making enemies of (insulting) others and making yourselves out
 to be better than you are, so that other people will not be indignant at you.
 165) And do not go to people of your kind (next ones) and amongst the people in order to preach that the teaching
 of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life shall be eradicated as a teaching of the laws
 and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and that those who teach and live according to
 it shall have a strict punishment meted out on them; truly, such doing is only performed by unfair ones (irre-
 sponsible ones) and belief-oriented priests of the gods, tin gods and demons, and there are no pretexts (ex-
 cuses) for this because such preaching amounts to all of the disgracefulness (badness/ignominy) that a person
 of your kind (human being) can load onto himself or herself in unrighteousness (consciencelessness).
166) Never forget what the true prophets warn you about through the teaching of the laws and recommendations
 of the wellspring of the love (Creation), so that you may save yourselves from the evil that is not recommen-
 ded to you, so that you do not impose a strict punishment on yourselves and that you do not have to accuse
 (blame) yourselves in strictness as ones who are rebelling against the truth of the primal power (creation) and
 as unfair ones (irresponsible ones).
167) Do not rebel defiantly against the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) that are given to
 you so that you may do rightfully and impose prohibitions on yourselves for those things that are unrightful;
 cultivate your thoughts and feelings in equitableness (fairness), in righteousness (conscientiousness) and in vir-
 tuousness so that you recognise yourselves in value as people of your kind (human beings) and you finally do
 not insult yourselves as contemptible apes.
168) And consider the words of the true prophets who teach and announce to you at their time that you will cer-
 tainly (without doubt) awaken on the day of your appraisal (cognition) of the truth of the laws and recommen-
 dations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and will exert pressure on and eliminate the evil in you with
 grim anguish so that you bring about a resurrection of the good and truthly in yourselves and you can forgive
 yourselves.
169) As all-embracing people of your kind (humankind), you are divided into tribes and peoples, and so there are
 some amongst you with a belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods, and others with a belief (assumptions) in
 other gods and tin gods; and therefore there are amongst you as all-embracing people of your kind (human-
 kind) righteous ones (conscientious ones) and fair ones (responsible ones), and there are amongst you some
 who are neither; but truly you are split up (not consolidated) in belief (assumptions) in gods, tin gods and
 demons so that you have many godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults), all of which offer falla-
 cious teachings with much more lying and slander (calumny) than real truth; therefore all godlinesses (religions)
 and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) are recommended to liberate themselves from their fabulated (invented) gods,
 tin gods and demons and to turn themselves to the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the well-
 spring of the love (Creation) so that they only continue to teach the truth and no longer lead all people of your
 kind (humankind) into confusion, but rather into the light of existence (reality), so that amongst all people of
 your kind (humankind) – in you and amongst you all – there may be true knowledge, truthly love and wisdom
 as well as peace and freedom and consonance (harmony).
170) You people of your kind (human beings), do not continue to allow awful things to come over you through the
 belief (assumptions) in gods, tin gods and demons as is preached to you in delusion by false prophets, priests,
 servants of gods, servants of tin gods and servants of demons who inherited false writings of false prophets
 and scribes and lead you into delusion with them; and do not reach for these delusional teachings or for the
 miserable goods of this world that mislead you into avarice and make you think (thinking) that you are more
 than people of your kind (fellow human beings) if you own more wealth and goods than the others; consider
 that the false prophets and false scribes have made a bond (agreement) with the untruth and slander (calumny),
 so that you also shall not reach for it and shall not allow yourselves to be led into delusion; only guide (lead)
 yourselves to the truthly teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life as is given to
 you through the teaching of the prophets, out of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring
 of the love (Creation), that has been researched by the true prophets and who have recognised the real truth
 in it and proclaim and teach it to you.
171) But those amongst you who hold fast to the false teachings of the false prophets and false scribes and make
 prayers to gods and tin gods in submissiveness, and who worship priests and other servants of gods and ser-
 vants of tin gods or people of your kind (human beings) as envoys or representatives (substitutes) of the gods,
 tin gods and demons, you lose the reward of righteousness (conscientiousness), of equitableness (fairness) and
 virtues, and your existence (life) will always be full of fear of punishment and of calamity.
172) Hold fast to the truth and do not allow mountains of unright and unrighteousness (consciencelessness) to fall
 down over you like a blanket, and be always conscious of the fact that only the truth can rescue you from
 levels of the unright and untruth.
173) And consider that if you bring forth (create) descendants from your loins that you shall teach (instruct) them the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life so that you do not make them into
witnesses against their own selves and against the truth, so that they become knowing of the true existence (reality) and are not unknowing of the truth at the end of their days.
174) If you do not turn to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life under your
 own power and out of your own true discernment (intellect) and if you place gods, tin gods, demons and spir-
 its next to the wellspring of the love (Creation) then do not lay the blame for this on your forefathers and fore-
 mothers (ancestors/ forebears) who did the same at an earlier time; consider that you are living long after them
 and are of other seed (generations) and are yourselves responsible for what you do; therefore it is given to you
 yourselves as to whether you follow the truth and take joy in good living or whether you destroy your good
 living for the sake of what you do that is deceitful and unfair (irresponsible).
175) Truly, you can see and recognise the signs (evidence) of the presence (existence) of the laws and recommen-
 dations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) in all its appearance (nature) if you would only comprehend
 (understand) it, so that you may return to the truth.
176) Do not go past the signs (evidence) of the appearance (nature) of the wellspring of the love (Creation) without heed- ing them, so you do not reach out your hand to the evil in you, so that you go into delusion and act unrightfully.
177) Raise yourselves up over evil and do not tend towards the earthly (material) and do not follow the evil desires
 that arise from it; do not demand excessively for earthly goods so that you do not resemble thirsty dogs which
 hang out their tongues when they are thirsty; therefore you shall not be the same as them and not thirstily
 chase after earthly goods and thereby forget the unfolding (evolution) of your inner world (consciousness), and
 not either the consonance (harmony) of your thoughts and feelings and your (psyche; therefore heed the signs
 (evidence) of the existence of the wellspring of the love (Creation) in its laws and recommendations of its
 appearance (nature) so that you are not deprived of the truth and you bethink the presentation (description/
 explanations) of the true prophets.
178) Truly, things stand badly with those amongst you who treat the signs (evidence) of the truth of the laws and
 recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) as a lie, because you are thereby lying against your
 own self and are slandering (calumniating) it.
179) Only if you allow yourselves to be led (guided) by the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the well-
 spring of the love (Creation) are you on the right way, but if you go astray then you are lost ones in existence
 (life), because you are afflicted by fear of punishment and calamity.
180) Truly, people of your kind (human beings) have created much calamity and shadows (hells) in the world and in
 themselves, and truly you are also doing the same as them; you have true discernment (intellect) but you do
 not use it and you have thoughts and feelings but you use them wrongly and do not understand their power,
 and you have eyes but you do not see and you have ears and do not hear, and truly you are like stubborn cat-
 tle when you should comprehend (understand) the truth; you have strayed badly from the truth and from the
 true equitableness (fairness) and righteousness (conscientiousness) and are truly inconsiderate, and so you are
 far from all truthly love and consonance (harmony), as well as far from any true freedom and the peace in you
 and amongst all people of your kind (humankind).
181) Search for the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and of its
 appearance (nature), call for it and unify yourselves with it, and do not allow at your side those who are fugi-
 tive from the truth, rather strive to teach them whilst keeping yourselves at a distance nevertheless so that they
 do not deceive you and do not make you go into confusion.
182) Consider, you are all created to learn the truth and to go hand-in-hand with it, and for you to lead (guide) peo-
 ple of your kind (fellow human beings) with the truth so that you practise equitableness (fairness) and they do
 the same.
183) And consider, if you repudiate the signs (evidence) of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the
 love (Creation) and of its appearance (nature) then you are making yourselves step-by-step responsible for the
 elimination of true love, for unpeace, for unfreedom (bondage), virtuelessness and for dissonance (disharmony)
 in yourselves and amongst people of your kind (fellow human beings), because you do not know the law of
 condition (cause) and of decision (effect = cause and effect) and therefore you do not act according to it.
184) You give yourselves free rein in your unknowledge regarding the truth, so you mightfully make room for in - equity (unfairness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness) which is used for waging battle (war) and for killing, in
order to practise hatred, revenge and retaliation and to commit all kinds of outrages (acts of Gewalt and crimes).
185) Consider the words of the true prophets which clearly warn you that you shall not be obsessed by terrible
 things and by evil.
186) Take a look at the realm of the firmaments (universe) and of the earths (worlds/planets), at the lights in the fir-
 mament (celestial bodies/comets, etc.), as well as at yourselves and at all kinds of life (life forms) and at all other
 things that are created through the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), and
 see that a fixed lifetime is given to all, so that everything is integrated into the appearing (becoming) and the
 disappearing (passing = becoming and passing), in order to be reawakened (reborn) at its time, however.
 187) Do not condemn yourselves to going astray, so that you have no leadership (guidance) through yourselves and
 you do not wander blindly through your existence (life) in intractability.
188) Do not ask during the time of your life when the hour will come that will be your last, so that you do not act
 unrightfully, but rather strive to learn the truth and to live according to it so that you can go on your way in
 joy at the end of your time; truly, even if you ask about the hour that will be your last during the time of your
 life then you cannot discover it because knowledge of it shall not weigh heavily upon you, so the hour (death)
 shall only break over you suddenly so that you are not sad in your existence (life), you do not become confused
 in your inner world (consciousness) and do not do terrible things and do not cause any calamity.
189) Truly, you as people of your kind (human being) have the might to benefit or to harm yourselves and people of your kind (fellow human beings), because neither a god nor tin god nor demon can determine over this,
because all of them are entirely merely fabulations (inventions) of people of your kind (human beings) who falla-
ciously set mights over you, who do not have any knowledge of the secret of what is hidden (creation), in which
the fullness (measure) of goodness and of true love is secured and which is not touched by terrible things.
190) It is the wellspring of the love (Creation) that created you out of its unchangeabilites (laws), man and woman;
 and as you are therefore its created creations (creatures/creations/life forms), you shall revive yourselves with
 everything that it has created for your benefit (success), and so you do rightfully and recognise and follow the
 laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), so you have a light burden to carry through-
 out your life; but if the burden becomes heavy for you then adjust yourselves in yourselves accordingly so that
 you will be of good courage and can with gratitude cast down (master) everything terrible.
191) And when things go well for you again and you are enjoying your life again, then do not impute (ascribe) it as a gift granted by gods, tin gods or demons, because truly it is you yourselves who give yourselves help and power
because you are unsurpassable (sublime) over all things that you undertake and that you place at your side.
192) Truly, although you can place things at your side according to your preference (will) as people of your kind (human beings), you cannot place anything next to the wellspring of the love (Creation) which could also be
equivalent to it in even a speck of dust of the weight, because as the creative one of all things (Creation), it is
sublime over everything because it is the wellspring (origin) and the condition (cause) of all reality (existence).
193) You as people of your kind (human beings), you are dependent on the power of the laws and recommenda- tions of the wellspring of the love (Creation) because they grant you help in all things providing you follow
their guidelines (explanations/instructions) and direct your existence (life) according to them, but you cannot
offer help to the laws and recommendations because you are only ordinary and do not have might over them.
194) And if you want the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) to bend according to
 you, then they do not do this, irrespective of whether you call upon or curse them or you are silent, because
 they are formed according to the idea of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and only integrated into its
 might, however not into yours.
195) Truly, those people of your kind (human beings) whom you call upon as envoys or representatives (substitutes)
 of gods, tin gods or demons for them to bend the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation)
 for you, they are as mightless as you yourselves, so that they can call out (call upon) whether by day or night
 and yet are unable to change anything, because they are not truthful (unfallible) and do not have the might
 of the wellspring of the love (Creation).
196) Truly, you do not have feet to go to the wellspring of the love (Creation), and therefore you do not have hands
 to grasp it, just as you do not have eyes to see it or ears to hear it, because truly it is of pure spiritual activity
 (energy) and power and is raised over all existence; therefore you shall honour and heed it and not call on gods
 and tin gods, neither on demons, just as you shall also not forge any cunnings against it, but rather you shall
 use your time to be connected to the truth of its laws and recommendations..
197) Truly, the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) are your protectors when you do right-
 fully; and from them comes forth the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life
 which you shall learn and follow so that you may be fair (responsible), righteous (conscientious) and virtuous
 people of your kind (human beings).
198) Those amongst you, however, who do not follow the truth and who call on gods and tin gods, you cannot be
 helped by the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) to become fair ones (respon -
 sible ones), righteous ones (conscientious ones) and virtuous ones, because you cannot help yourselves.
199) And if you call upon your gods and tin gods, then they do not hear you, because something that is not living
 (not connected to the truth and knowing) cannot give an answer, and therefore you cannot look at (see) what
 is existing.
200) Be at all times lenient (forgiving) towards people of your kind (fellow human beings) and towards all creatures
 (life forms) and practise benevolence; turn away from what is unfair (irresponsible) so that you may be fair to
 all in your existence (life).
 201) And if you are urged by an evil whispering from yourselves or through people of your kind (fellow human
 beings, then take refuge in the truth of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and in its laws and recommenda-
 tions so that you do not fall prey to evil and unfairness (irresponsibility).
202) Truly, if you are fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones) and are connected to the
 true teaching of the prophets, then you will think of (be reminded to) the truth when you start to see (under-
 stand) that you are befallen by evil whisperings, so you defend yourselves against them.
203) Therefore, always heed the truth in whatever things so that you obtain help from the truth and do not fall into
 erroneous assumption or continue in erroneous assumption; and if you turn away from the erroneous assump-
 tion, then it cannot pursue you or bring you onto the wrong way.
204) And if you see the signs (evidence) of the truth of the reality (existence) of the primal power (Creation) in the
 appearance (nature) and in the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), then do
 not invent false truths (lies) and slanders (calumnies) about them, rather follow the signs (evidence) that are
 revealed to you; truly the signs (evidence) of the wellspring of the love (Creation) are clear, and they are a clear
 leadership (guidance) for all peoples of all people of your kind (humankind).
205) And if the true teaching of the prophets is presented to you, which is created from the laws and recommen-
 dations of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and its appearance (nature), then lend it your ear so that you
 obtain cognition and true discernment (intellect) and clear-sightedness (understanding), so you find pity in
 yourselves and you become fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones).
206) And consider the truth at all times in an open wise of your inner world (consciousness), so that you do not fall
 into submissiveness and fear in front of it, and so that you do not speak great words about it morning and
 evening, so those who are searching for the truth do not turn away from it and become neglectful ones.
207) Truly, if you are close to the real truth of the wellspring of the love (Creation) and its laws and recommenda-
 tions, as well as its appearance (nature), then no longer turn away from it arrogantly (vainly), but steep your-
 selves in it even more so that you may become even more knowing and wise and can live your life in true love
 and inner freedom as well as in peace and consonance (harmony).
