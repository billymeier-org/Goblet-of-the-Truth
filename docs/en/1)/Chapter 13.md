# Chapter 13
1) The teaching of the prophets is the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life as
 has been revealed through the true prophets since time immemorial.
2) The teaching teaches the predetermined fulfilment which is the unfolding (evolution) of the inner world (con-
 sciousness) of people of your kind (human beings).
3) For this purpose, all things are regulated (determined) through the Creation and its laws and recommendations
 which are the laws and recommendations of all determination of the proceeding and the ceasing (becoming
 and passing).
4) All things are regulated (determined) through the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations, both on
 your world and in all firmaments (universe) as well as on all earths (worlds/planets), and in all lights of the
 firmament (moons/stars/nebulas/comets, etc.).
5) Heed the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations so that you may do rightfully and lead your lives
 rightfully, so that you do not create punishment in yourselves for things which you do unrightfully.
6) Therefore be also full of forgiveness for all people of your kind (human beings) who commit misdeeds (do
 unrightfully), but truly you cannot avoid integrating malefactors into a punishment, which, however, shall be
 fair (responsible) and appropriate, but not harm either body or life or the inner world (consciousness) or the
 psyche.
7) Truly, each thing has its measure, such as the punishment for misdeeds, as well as everything else that arises
 in the existence (life); however, because you do not know the signs (evidence) for this and you also do not strive
 to recognise the signs (evidence) of this in the appearance (nature) and therefore in the proceeding (creational)
 laws and recommendations, true prophets come to you in order to reveal everything and to proclaim the
 hidden things of the proceeding (Creation) to you.
8) However, the true prophets are not rulers over you, but are ambassadors of the truth and leaders as well as
 admonishers (warners) for you, so that you may see all things in the right measure.
9) The true prophets are the knowers of the hidden and of the visible, but do not place themselves over you, so
 that you are always yourselves and you guide (lead) and think out (form) everything according to your own
 knowledge and your own admonishment (conscience).
10) Truly, to yourselves is due the honour for your good actions and deeds, because you undertake them yourselves
 and they do not belong to the doing of any tin gods or gods which you call on and make supplications to in
 your confused belief (assumptions) in them, and which do not listen to you in any case; truly, you alone are
 listening to yourselves when you call on your inner world (consciousness) and you complete your deeds
 through your thoughts and feelings and actions, because no gods or tin gods do you either good or ill, being
 only hazy pictures (figments of the imagination), rather it is out of yourselves that you complete everything just
 as if you stretch out your hand for water for it to reach your mouth; if, however, you assume (believe) that your
 hand stretching out for water for it to reach your mouth has been guided by some god or tin god, then you
 are merely entertaining wasted thoughts about something that is truthly not given and also cannot be.
11) Wherever you are on your world or in the firmaments (universe) or on earths (worlds/planets), do not throw
 yourselves down willingly or unwillingly before gods or tin gods, because either they are merely fabulations
 (inventions) of confused people of your kind (human beings) or they are people of your kind (human beings)
 who presume to raise themselves up as gods before you.
12) Gods and tin gods are no helpers for you, because they have no might in order either to harm or to help you
 or themselves; consider as an allegory (comparison) that blind and sighted people cannot be the same as one
 another in observation (perception) just as the dark and the light are not the same, and in the same wise gods
 and tin gods are hazy pictures (pictures of the imagination) invented by people of your kind (human beings) or
 power and strength which are given to you and which you can use in cognition (rationality) and true discern-
 ment (intellect); therefore do not bow down (submit) before hazy (fleeting) delusions of supposed gods and
 tin gods because you alone are truthly present (existent) and full of power and strength through which you
 can complete everything that you desire, whether it be for good or ill, according to your righteousness (con-
 scientiousness) or unrighteousness (consciencelessness).
13) Know at all times what is revealed to you through the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations by
 means of signs (evidence) of their presence (existence), so that you may recognise false and true and keep it,
 so it does not escape you as foam which forms bubbles which immediately burst.
14) Goodness is determined by the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations to those who are extensively
 (amply) connected to the truth and the truth-teaching in such a wise that truthly love awakens in them, and peace
 as well as freedom and consonance (harmony), as great values which are also carried to the outside and prompt
 (encourage) people of your kind (fellow human beings) to create the same in themselves.
15) But it is the truth that only those turn to the truth and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
 teaching of the life who use their recognition (rationality) and their true discernment (intellect) and knowingly
 (consciously) and willingly want to consider (think about) the truth.
 16) Those, however, who connect everything that goes forth from and is recommended by the proceeding (cre-
 ational) laws and recommendations, connect themselves to the proceeding (Creation) itself and are not afraid
 to stand up according to right and law as well as due measure and obligation (responsibility) for what is right-
 ful, of righteousness (conscientiousness), equitableness (fairness) and of fairness (responsibility), because they
 do not know any fear in going against the untruth and unrighteousness (consciencelessness) as well as what
 is unfair (irresponsible) and inequity (unfairness).
17) They remain steadfast in demanding the true life in truthly love and freedom as well as in demanding peace and consonance (harmony) in themselves and in the world amongst all people of your kind (humankind).
18) Learn to avert evil through goodness, so that peace may be upon you and upon people of your kind (fellow
 human beings) and you may be good to one another in love, knowledge and wisdom.
19) Therefore learn to recognise the signs (evidence) of the truth so that you may follow the guidelines (basic rules)
 of the laws and recommendations of the proceeding (Creation) and you may find your consolation in it if afflic-
 tion befalls you.
20) And truly, happiness and joy are given to all in themselves who do good deeds in following the truth, because
 in their inner nature there is a homestead of true love, peace, freedom and of consonance (harmony).
21) But there are many amongst you who consider the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teach-
 ing of the life to be a lie, because you are bound to gods and tin gods and bound to false prophets who lie to
 you and make you believe that through their teaching of lies and their knowledge (belief) it is possible to move
 mountains and for you to speak with the dead, but truly everything is merely a lie and slander (calumny)
 against the truthly truth; truly, the word that mountains can be moved by belief (assumptions) is not possible,
 because it is only given as an allegory (comparison) that through knowledge it is possible to win (achieve) con-
 siderable things (very much); and that you can speak with the dead is merely a lie and deception, because
 something that is dead can neither be returned to life nor can it make itself understandable to people of your
 kind (human beings) in voice (words) or in thoughts.
22) If, however, you assume (believe) in these lies of the false prophets and those who follow the false teachings
 of the false prophets, then you will persist in unknowledge of the truth, therefore the calamity of your delu-
 sion (deluded belief) will not cease and will strike you again and again, and lead you into erroneous assump-
 tion and confusion, so that in good time (sooner or later) you will be struck by the boiling heat (madness/
 schizophrenia) in your inner world (consciousness) and you will no longer be able to differentiate between
 occurrence (reality) and unoccurrence (unreality/illusion).
23) Truly, not only are there many amongst you who mock the true prophet, but even before you there were already
 many who mocked the prophets and did not accept their teaching as the truth, because they were unfair ones
 (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and were fully uneducated in the truth; but
 you can see what has truly come of this, that things that were previously still good are today turned into bad-
 ness and evil, and this will continue if you do not listen to the teaching of the prophets, to the teaching of the
 truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, which is created by the true prophets out of the laws
 and recommendations of the proceeding (Creation).
24) Truly, what you do not know about the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations is proclaimed to
 you by the prophets with the words of their teaching, and it is not merely an empty speech in order to make
 it appear pleasing to your eyes and ears, rather it is a speech of the truth through which you shall not be kept
 away from the right way, so that you do not go into confusion and so that you may find a true leader (guide)
 in the laws and recommendations of the proceeding (Creation).
25) Truly, the figure (extent) of the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations is endlessly great and wide
 (very extensive), and its fruits (effects) are everlasting and good for you if you follow their guidelines (rules),
 but they cast shadows over you if you are against them and have contempt for them.
26) Therefore, follow the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and fulfil the
 proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations within the extent (frame) of fairness (responsibility) and
 righteousness (conscientiousness) and in equitableness (fairness), so that it shall be well with you and you may
 live in yourselves and outside yourselves in love and peace, as well as in freedom and consonance (harmony),
 as is taught to you by the true prophets.
27) They reveal the truth of the laws and recommendations of the proceeding (Creation) to you as clear guidance
 which you truly cannot misunderstand, if you strive to do so and do not follow evil cravings which go astray
 (deviate) from the knowledge and wisdom; take the clear guidance and follow it so that you may find true
 protection and friendship therein.
28) And also heed the signs (evidence) of the truth that you see and find in the proceeding (creational) laws and recommendations, as they are also given to you in the appearance (nature) so that you only need to see (notice)
them and to estimate (assess) them according to your cognition (intellect) and true discernment (rationality).
