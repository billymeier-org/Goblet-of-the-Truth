# Chapter 2
 1) In the name of the truth, the equitableness (fairness) and the wisdom, this is a teaching through which the
  many laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) are revealed; and there is no doubt in this;
  and the teaching is a guideline (sign-posting/leading thought) for the leading of the life.
 2) And those who are knowing about the unseen (the unconscious) and those who do their duty as it was re -
  vealed before you by the proclaimers, the prophets, and those of you who are building firmly on what comes
  out of it, they are the true ones living in equitableness (fairness/responsibility).
 3) And those who are knowing about the unseen (the unconscious) and about the laws and recommendations
  of the primal power (Creation) as had already been revealed to you in the old time, and if you give from what
  is given to you through the appearance (nature) and the formation (Creation) then you are acting in equi-
  tableness (fairness) in this wise; and those who do that are following the guidance of the prophet, and it will
  go well with them.
4) Those amongst you who are not knowing – it makes no difference to them whether they are warned or are
 not warned –, they do not want to be knowing.
5) All their senses are sealed, their intellect and their rationality, their hearts, their ears, and over their eyes there
 is a shroud, through which they do severe punishment to themselves.
6) And there are some amongst you who say that they are connected to the knowledge and the truth, but they
 are truthly not knowing ones .
7) They wish to deceive the proclaimers, the prophets, and those who are knowing; but they are only deceiving
 themselves; but their intellect is not sufficient to understand it.
8) There was disease in their reflecting and their disease has multiplied due to their wrong doing and their lies.
9) And if they are told that they shall not cause trouble on the earth-roundness, then they say untruthfully that
 they are promoting peace.
10) And if they are told that they shall be knowing in the truth and not believing like fools, then they dissent, there-
 fore protect yourselves from them, because they do not know that they are fools.
11) And if they meet those who are knowing, then they lie saying that they are also knowing; however, when they
 are together with their ringleaders, they ingratiate themselves with them and lie that they share the same opin-
 ion as them and are only making fun of the knowing ones.
12) They themselves will be punished for their mockery because they remain obdurate in their outrages; because
 they are blinded and are going into the unreal.
13) They are those who have exchanged their true guidance by the truth for the lunacy that controls them, because
 they are leading themselves into the unreal, and their deeds will bring them no gain.
14) They are like a man who kindles a fire amongst his own family; and when everything about him is lit up then puts out the fire and takes the light away, and thus they sit in deep darkness, so they can no longer see anything.
15) They are deaf, dumb and blind, and so they will not find the truth.
16) Or they are like in a rain from heavy clouds, in which darkness, thunder and lightning reside, and they stop up
 their ears with their fingers in mortal fear of the thunderclaps and believe that the storm cannot harm them
 even though the lighting may strike down.
17) The lighting almost takes away the light of their eyes; whenever its luminescence comes down to them then
 they walk in its light; and when it goes out and darkness extends over them then they all stand still and are
 afraid; and if it were possible for them to do so, then they would give away their hearing, their eyes and their
 face so as to be free from their fear.
18) You (human beings), turn yourselves to the truth and to the Creation from the might of which you have pre-
 ceded and are created, just like all those who went before you; turn to the truth so you shall be worthy of the
 equitableness (fairness/responsibility).
19) You shall be connected to the real truth alone, because only through it can all things prosper rightfully and
 lead to success, and only the real truth is in love the sign-posting (leading thought) of the life.
20) Only the truth is the way that leads to your development, whereas displeasure is created on all sides by the untruth of all those who are going into the unreal and deny the truth or replace the truth with a religious belief.
21) The truth that you have got to live is perfect because it is given by the primal power (Creation) and its appear-
 ance (creational nature) and is without any doubt.
22) The real truth is not equivalent to and cannot be compared to your personal truth that you create in your-
 selves based on your belief and understanding according to your own nature (individuality).
23) Truth is that which is given in reality and is evidential, whereas belief is bindingly linked to that which as the
 unseen (the unconscious) and the unprovable is erroneously assumed to be true.
24) You shall know what the truth of the reality revealed and is revealing to you, and you shall firmly build on what
 the truth will bring you in the future.
25) The in truth knowing ones are the ones who are following the guidance of the truth, and so it will go well
 with them.
26) You who do not know about the real truth, but who are bound up with a belief, it makes no difference to you
 whether you are warned against the untruth or not, because for you the belief is more important than the real
 truth.
27) You who are far from the truth because of belief or as a wiseacre or gainsayer, your rationality and your intel-
 lect are sealed; your ears are deaf, your eyes are blind, and your senses are enveloped in a shroud, which means
 that your life is burdensome and you are in constant fear of punishment.
28) If you break the bond of the Creation that it has established between you and it, and if you cut this bond that
 was created by a connective recommendation, then you are creating unpeace on Earth, and then you are the
 losers.
29) How can you deny the formation (Creation), because through it you have received your very life, because it
 gave life to you; but it will also let you die, although to give life back to you in a long succession and always
 in new persons, and then you will return to the formation (Creation) in the far future.
 30) It is the formation (Creation) that created everything for you that is on Earth through its might; and it per-
  fected everything in the firmament (universe) and on Earth.
 31) The formation (Creation) has placed you (human beings) on Earth to govern; and you shall not use people of
  your kind (human beings) for creating unpeace on Earth and shedding blood.
 32) However, those of you who give the appearance of knowing the truth and that you are also connected to it,
  although you unwittingly fall prey to the lie and are only believers, it is you who are attempting to deceive the
  truth.
 33) You have no knowledge except for that which you are capable of learning through the laws and recommen-
  dations of the primal power (Creation) and through the laws of the appearance (nature), because your
  thoughts and feelings result from them.
 34) The true proclaimer, the true prophet, he knows many secrets of the firmament (universe) and the earths
  (worlds), and he knows what the laws and recommendations of the Creation and the laws of the appearance
  (nature) reveal, but the secret that is also unmeasurable for him is the origination (Creation) itself.
 35) Those amongst you who deceive the truth through your beliefs are only deceiving yourselves, but this is be-
  yond your intellect because you do not comprehend it.
 36) You who are far from the truth and are only connected to a belief, your rationality and your intellect have fallen
  victim to an illness of the confusion that is based on deception and lie, which is why you suffer the pangs of
  torments in fear of the possible punishments that might be hanging over your heads.
 37) And if the truth-deniers and the believers are told that they shall not cause any turmoil or any unpeace on Earth,
  then they deny their intentions, they lie and deceive, perjure themselves, bless weapons in order to be victo-
  rious in battles (wars) and in killing (murdering), and they claim to be promoters of the love, the peace and the
  consonance (harmony).
 38) Guard yourselves against the truth-deniers, the truth-twisters and against the fanatical believers, because they
  are the ones who are stirring up trouble as well as creating lovelessness, unpeace and unfreedom, although
  they do not comprehend it.
 39) Get out, all of you, out of your wrong thoughts, and follow the guidance of the true proclaimers, the prophets,
  so that no fear will fall upon you and you will not have to sorrow.
 40) If the truth-deniers, the truth-twisters, wiseacres and the believers are told that only the real truth is important and that they must strive for the real truth, then they do not want to turn towards the truth but remain living
 in their lies and falsifications, as well as in the denial of the truth, and in the irrational belief, because they are
 fools and for this reason you shall guard against them if you do not know about their foolishness (irrationality).
 41) You (human beings), remember the good deeds of the creative (Creation) as have been presented to you since
  time immemorial and continue to be presented; therefore fulfil your bond with it so that your life will be rich,
  satisfied and of long duration and you will find your protection in yourselves and in the fulfilment of the laws
  and recommendations of the primal power (Creation).
 42) Know about the truth and about everything that the creative (Creation) has created and sent down to you on
  Earth as confirmation of what is disastrous and also of how things will be with you in the future if you fail in
  knowledge about the truth and you barter away the signs (the unsurpassable) of the creative (Creation) for a
  miserable price.
 43) When believers, wiseacres, opponents, truth-deniers and truth-twisters meet with those who are truth-con-
  scious, then they say that they themselves are also connected to the truth; however, when they are alone with
  those of the same views then they laugh and say that they are only mocking the truth-knowers.
 44) You who mock the ones who are truth-conscious, you are committing an outrage on yourselves and punishing
  all-of-yourself (yourselves) through your going into the unreal and your blindness.
 45) The truth-deniers and the believers have sunk in their going into the unreal into a false conduct, as a result of
  which their thoughts and feelings as well as their actions do not produce any evolutive success or gain, which
  is an unavoidable consequence of having been led astray by themselves as well as by others, meaning that they
  live in deep darkness and cannot see or recognise the truth.
 46) Search for help in the patience and truth, which – although it may be difficult – will reward anyone who makes
  the effort.
 47) Those of you who certainly know the truth will meet it everywhere and return to it again and again.
 48) Oh you (human beings), think of the good deeds of the formation (Creation) and of the appearance (nature)
  created from it, and think of your life which would not be without it.
 49) And fear the day on which none of the people of your kind (human being) gives account for you as a help-
  meet (substitute) and does not intercede for you and also cannot afford any ransom when you are in misery
  and you have to vindicate yourselves before life.
 50) Truth-deniers, believers, wiseacres, truth-falsifiers and adversaries of the truth are deaf, dumb and blind to the
  reality, therefore they cannot find the way to the real truth of the reality.
  51) Belief and untruth create anxieties and fear of death in you, therefore you shall turn to the truth so that you
will become knowing and you can free yourselves from anxiety and fear.
  52) Think of the time when the prophets made you promises that you would have a good life in the far future if you turned to the true teaching of the truth and the teaching of the spirit and the teaching of the life; but you
  have failed to observe the promises and have continued to walk the path of the truth-denial, therefore today
  turmoil, inequity (unfairness), lovelessness, peacelessness, unfreedom and disharmony reign in you; but the
  proclaimers, the prophets, forgave you so that you may be thankful, but you have cast everything to the wind
  and cursed the prophets, but they have come back in order to teach you the real truth up to the current day.
  53) Think of the time when the prophets told you that you have gone against yourselves and are doing inappro-
priate things to yourselves because you are praying to gods and tin gods and are turning further and further
away from the primal raising (Creation); and you have continued to do so up to the current day, and you have
killed your next ones and fought battles (wars) with bloody deeds (murder) and fire in the name of a fabulated
(invented) god in order to provide cowardly vindication for your terrible actions.
  54) Your world and all the life in it have come about through the truth and love of the sole and all-embracing
primal wellspring (Creation), through the principles of the inner world of the firmaments (universal conscious-
ness), as a bed for you and the firmament as a roof, the earth as arable land and water as refreshment so that
food may be brought forth, therefore the primal wellspring (Creation) shall not have any god, any demons,
any liberators (angels), any venerable ones (holy ones) or helpers (substitutes) set at its side.
  55) If you attempt to belittle the truth of the creative (Creation) by attempting to place a god, a tin god or liberators (angels) and venerable ones (holy ones) or demons at its side, in whom you fallaciously believe and to whom
  you offer prayers, then you are committing an outrage with regard to the principles of the primal power (Cre-
  ation) and to yourselves, and are casting all-of-yourself into a fire which robs you of intellect and rationality.
  56) And you say that you do not want to place your trust in the prophet in any wise even at the present time for
his teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the life until you have experienced their truth with
your own body and with your own reflecting and striving, and are able to see their efficacy with your own
eyes; but in return the thunderclap of a disagreeable present existence befalls you.
  57) Bringing the joyful message of the truth to those amongst you who are knowing or not-knowing and are
connected to the truth or are not connected to it and who do good or bad deeds means love and joy, which
should belong to all of you so that in you gardens of the consonance (harmony) blossom and rivers of the wis-
dom flow; and whenever you give from the fruits of your garden (knowledge) and from the waters of your
rivers (wisdom) to people of your kind (human beings), you will say that you are passing on that what you have
been taught by the wise ones and the prophets in accordance with the laws of the primal power (Creation),
therefore you pass it on in the same form as it was given to you; and this leads to you finding yourselves as
people of your kind (human beings) and becoming companions in order to care for your being yourself (being
human) in purity and to dwell therein.
  58) The true proclaimer, the prophet, as well as the true wise one does not disdain to give an allegory (compari-
son) as a means of instruction, may it be ever so small as a gnat or a tiny detail, because it bears witness to
the truth for those who are learning and also for those who have knowledge of the truth, which can be taught
and understood through the allegory (comparison).
  59) What the proclaimer, the prophet, or the wise one says with an allegory (comparison) is what serves as an
explanation with words as examples so that it is understood and shows the one who is learning that there does
not have to be any unknowledgeness and none amongst you has to be a confused one, also that no one shall
be led into being confused or condemned as an unknowing one.
  60) If you break the bond with the truth that was set up as a binding link and then was cut and destroyed, then
you are creating unpeace on Earth and you will come out as losers.
  61) How can you deny the creative (Creation) and its truth and laws, because only through the existence of the
creative (Creation) and its principles, which bear witness of love and truth, did all life come forth, life that dies
and is reborn in order to be completed through learning and to one day become one with it.
  62) It is the creative (Creation) alone which created everything that is on Earth and in the unending expanses of
the universe, and it created and completed all life and existence through its logical principles that are founded
in truth; and therefore it is the creative (Creation) that forms the breath of the life as a part-piece in you and
in all life forms as well as in everything existing.
  63) Truly, the knowing ones, the wise ones, the black ones, the yellow ones, the red ones, the white ones, blue
ones, green ones and everyone of any kind who truly stands in the knowledge about the truth of the forma-
tion (Creation), they will receive their fair reward during their lifetimes; and no fear will come over them, nor
will they sorrow.
  64) Hold fast to what the prophets gave you and will give you in future; keep their teaching of the truth in your
mind and everything that is contained in the teaching so that your present existence may be good and you
may be rescued from the unknowledge.
65) However, if you turn away from the truth then you fall out of the grace and boon of the life, and you will
 certainly be the losers.
66) And the Creation created all pre-requisites of the truth so that these reveal their truth through their principles
 and through the life and through you yourselves, namely by you creating love, peace, freedom and consonance
 (harmony) and swelling (evolving) in the inner world (consciousness) in knowledge and in wisdom, and by you
 remaining distant from all lovelessness, unfreedom, all disharmony and thereby do not cause any unpeace or
 shed any blood of your kind (blood of human beings), but respect the life in its wholeness.
67) And the truth teaches equitableness (fairness) so that any one of you may stand before the other when he or
 she is in the right.
68) Your knowledge must be controlled and you shall broaden the knowledge, which you learn through the laws
 of the appearance (nature) and the principles of the primal power (Creation), through your own efforts of
 fathoming to love, freedom as well as peace, sonority (harmony) and wisdom so that you will become relatively
 all-knowing and wise.
69) You people of your kind (human beings) of Earth, in the name of the truth it is said to you that you are able
 to fathom the secrets of the laws of the appearance (nature) and the principles of the primal power (Creation),
 because when you make the effort to do this they reveal to you what you conceal from yourselves as a result
 of your imperiousness.
70) You people of your kind (human beings) of Earth, think of the time when you were still without belief connected to the real truth and were not far from the truth; therefore return yourselves to that condition when you had con-
nected yourselves, not through an irrational belief but through the truth, to the Creation and did not pray to any god.
71) Do not, people of your kind (human beings), man and woman of Earth, bow down before gods, because they
 are falsehoods and inventions and lies made by people of your kind (human beings) who, in the delusion, be-
 came believers by inventing untrue higher mights and praying to them; you shall not do as they do and shall
 not pray either to them nor to their invented gods.
72) Do not, people of your kind (human beings) of Earth, bow down before people of your kind (fellow human
 beings), even not before those in authority because even if they bear grand titles and have wealth, they are
 not worth any more than you.
73) People of your kind (human beings), man, woman and child, dwell in the large garden of Earth and eat richly
 of all that is given to you through the appearance (nature) and the animals and other creatures, and also is
 created by you, and enjoy the fermented juices of the fruits in moderate amounts, so that you do not become
 drunk, and eat the flesh of all animals and other creatures (birds, fishes, reptiles, etc.) in good measure, from
 birds and rabbits through to pigs, cattle and camels, only do not do this shamefully and do not fall into glut-
 tony and greed so that you are not malefactors (lawbreakers).
74) People of your kind (human beings), you shall not stray from the straight and narrow when faced with the evil
 and shall not be of help to it, otherwise you will be driven from the place in which you live and you will be
 ostracised until the end of your days.
75) People of your kind (human beings), go away from those who believe themselves to be your enemies, but re-
 member to do good to them and not to hate them, but to be connected to them in love, even if you have to
 speak openly of their shameful actions; never deem another to be your enemy on your own account, be-
 cause you shall be connected to people of your kind (human beings) in love and be helpful to them in all good
 things.
76) It is to be considered by you that the dwelling of people of your kind (human beings) are the earths and also
 only for a time, which is why you shall make them beneficial to people of your kind (fellow human beings) and
 to the best, and shall not harm or destroy them.
77) The natural laws of the primal power (Creation) have been given which have a helpful effect when they are
 followed and applied; and truly if they are followed then everything will lead to the prosperousness and to the
 success as well as to the joy, to the love, to the peace and to the concord (harmony) and wisdom.
78) It is recommended for all to go out into the free appearance (nature) in order to recognise its laws and then
 to follow its guidance, so that the fear of the death will be banished and no one will need to sorrow in un-
 intellect (foolishness) when the present existence comes to an end.
79) However, remaining in the unknowledge and disregarding the signs (wonderful things) of the appearance
 (nature) and both its and the formation-given (Creation-given) and natural laws and imputing them as a lie
 amounts to self-punishment because your life will be full of false peace, false freedom and love, full of unknowl -
 edge, unwisdom, joylessness and dissonance (disharmony) as a result of which you will be disrupted in your
 swelling (evolution) of your inner world (consciousness) and will slow down (stagnate).
80) People of your kind (human beings) of Earth, think of the unending goodness of the life and the good deeds
 which have been presented and created for you since time immemorial for all those of you who followed the
 natural and forming (creational) laws and guidelines.
81) There is a bond between you people of your kind (human beings) as well as between the laws of the Creation and the appearance (nature) which must be fulfilled, because only this fulfilment guaranties that no fear has
to be nourished against the life and the death, because the laws of the primal power (Creation) and the natural laws are formed in such a wise that they fulfil themselves in any case; but you alone determine in the good or in the bad whether fear or unfear shall stir in you.
82) What has been created by the laws of the primal power (Creation) is a confirmation of what was thought out
 from an idea and created in love by the inner world of the firmaments (universal consciousness), by the
 Creation; but you are the ones who refuse yourselves the truth and have fallen into belief in gods instead of
 being in the knowledge about the truth, meaning that you cannot negotiate with yourselves in order to free
 yourselves from the very poor belief and turn to the truth which alone offers you protection.
83) Never shall falseness be mixed with truth, nor shall the truth be knowingly concealed.
84) The principles of the primal power (Creation) are laid out to care for the obligation of the knowledge to be
 striven for and of the wisdom for the truth, and for you not to bow down to any of your kind (human beings)
 nor to any divinities, however to be concerned to help those who suffer privation with appropriate gifts.
85) Others shall not be admonished to do the right whilst one's own doing that is unright goes forgotten; this is
 a recommendation that must be well understood.
86) Help must be sought in insight and patience, which is admittedly difficult unless for someone who is rich in
 the inner world (consciousness) and who does not walk along in submissiveness, but in truth, in love, knowl-
 edge and wisdom.
87) Those who are certainly knowing will unceasingly meet the truth and always find their way to it.
88) People of your kind (human beings) of Earth, always remember the good deeds of people of your kind (fellow
 human beings) which they presented or present to you, and do not raise yourselves up above them.
89) Fear the untruth for it can never serve as an authorised one (substitute) and intercession for the real truth and
 it cannot offer any ransom, because it does not help, rather takes and destroys.
90) Remember all the evil and the anguish that is afflicted upon many in the world by battles (wars), by criminals and murderers, through which sons and fathers are slaughtered and daughters and mothers raped and killed.
91) And remember the long times before the time of today when mendacious promises were given by the mighty
 ones in the world that no more battles (wars) shall be fought, and nevertheless uncountable lives of people of
 your kind (human lives) are sacrificed to the moloch battle (war) and immense destructions are wrought.
92) And it is the truth that, instead of being thankful for every day of peace, you continue to spread death, ruin
 and destruction in the name of an unsubstantial (imaginary) god who preaches love whilst absurdly demanding
 punishment, death and annihilation.
93) And prophets came to you with manifest signs (marvels and truth-teaching) by means of which the many laws
 and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) were explained, but in their absence you created tin gods
 and prayed to them, and therefore you were malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth.
94) For the wellspring-given (Creation-given) life and the appearance (nature) with all its life forms, the inner world
 of the firmaments (universal consciousness) allotted that thankfulness shall be nurtured for this in love, peace,
 freedom, consonance (harmony) and truth.
95) Thankfulness shall prevail for the differentiaton between right and unright, as well as between truth and un-
 truth, so that everyone may be led rightly.
96) It is to be considered that you are placing a heavy burden on yourselves through all your desire for unright,
 through your belief in divinities and praying to them in irresponsibility, because you are denying the real truth
 through binding yourselves to an imaginary god, elevating it to be the creator of the worlds and the universe,
 paying homage to it and killing people of your kind (fellow human beings) through battle (war) and punish-
 ment in its name.
97) The large mass of you does not want to know in any wise and does not want to recognise the truth unless
 you can hold the things of the truth in your hands, see them with your eyes and hear them with your ears, but
 the real truth of the real truth is not that of the holding, the seeing and the hearing, rather it is that of the
 inner cognition through rationality and intellect as well as of the true knowledge and the wisdom that are fully
 free from beliefs.
98) The truth of the life is that after this life death takes control, after which a new all-of-yourself (personality) is
 set up in a new life, for which thankfulness shall be given.
99) The laws of the primal power (Creation) and the natural laws let the clouds appear in the firmament and move
 from place to place because they bring water (rain) down, through which all kinds of edible things can thrive
 and all life is nourished, but people of your kind (human being) damage everything and thereby inflict the
 greatest harm on themselves.
100) A person of your kind (human being) shall always eat from all the gifts of the appearance (nature) that serve
 him or her as nourishment, and he or she shall have of it what he or she wants, and in addition in abundance,
 but he or she shall not beget abundant offspring in return, because he or she shall have a surplus of natural
 foodstuffs and not suffer from hunger.
 101) A person of your kind (human being) does not have to be satisfied with one kind of food, because he or she
  shall work to bring out of the earth what can be grown from its corn and its herbs, fruits and vegetables; there-
  fore he or she does not have to accept something less in return for something better if he or she goes about
  his or her work industriously; and whoever cannot undertake the work and the harvests himself or herself
  should go to the town where he or she can find what he desires in return for payment.
 102) Forgiving the errors and offences of people of your kind (fellow human beings) means showing equitableness
  (fairness) and doing good.
 103) Only those without equitableness (inequitable ones/irresponsible ones/unfair ones) confuse the word of the
  truth with lies, but the liars cause unending damage to themselves with this because they have no true friends,
  only false friends who tell them what they want to hear.
 104) It is rightful to be truthly at all times and never to bring hardships on people of your kind (fellow human beings) and on Earth by creating lovelessness, unfreedom, peacelessness, joylessness and discordance (disharmony).
 105) Many are smitten with misery and ignominy by inflicting torment and Gewalt on themselves because they bur-
  den themselves with their own anger and because since time immemorial they have in their intractability and
  in their outrageousness repudiated the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and wish to
  kill the true proclaimers, the prophets.
 106) Truly, those who really have knowledge about the truth of the primal power (Creation) and who live, act and
  do good works in accordance with the laws of the primal power (Creation), they will receive their reward in
  the form of joy, love, peace, freedom, concordance (harmony) and wisdom, therefore no fear of the life and
  of the death will come over them, and their sorrow will be kept within reasonable bounds.
 107) It is recommended to hold fast to what has been given through the principles of the primal power (Creation)
  and the natural principles, and all this that has been given shall be remembered for all time so that no hard-
  ships result from wrong thoughts, feelings and deeds.
 108) You people of your kind (human beings), do not turn away from the grace given by the laws of the primal well- spring (Creation), and from the prosperousness in all things, because otherwise you will live your life as a loser.
 109) The person of your kind (human being) must not be like apes or like those despised through misdeeds, be-
  cause he or she alone must account for his or her own actions, deeds, thoughts and feelings, something which
  is lacking in the apes and the human beings who have become despised through lawbreaking; this must be
  taken into cognisance and observed on a daily basis.
 110) It is always to be thought about that even those despised because of misdeeds are people of your kind (human
  beings) who must be given their right and must not be condemned or mistreated as such, because only their
  misdeeds shall be judged (legally assessed, i.e. condemned) in order to demand appropriate atonement from
  the fallible one.
 111) Those without equitableness (inequitable ones/irresponsible ones/unfair ones), fallible ones and those despised
  because of misdeeds as well as their wrong doing and their wrong thoughts and feelings shall serve as an
  example to everyone who is living at their time or comes after them; and it shall be a teaching to live not in
  fear of the unright, but in joy with the equitable (fair/responsible).
 112) The primal wellspring (Creation) and its laws and recommendations do not command as is the case with divinities created by people of your kind (human beings) and those who make a mockery of the truth and want to lead
 those into the unreal who are attempting to escape from their unknowledge and are seeking refuge in the truth.
 113) The dead are not to be mourned, rather the living dead, who lead their present existence in unknowledge, un- wisdom, lovelessness, unfreedom, unpeace and in inequality (disharmony), and are at odds with their life.
 114) Always ask your next ones to make it clear what they want, so that understanding is the result and not discord,
  strife and not hatred and not unpeace that come out of misunderstanding; this is how the behaviour in right-
  ness is to be.
 115) Request that the next ones always offer the truth and clearness in all things, just as everyone shall themselves
  be connected to the truth and clearness, because only in this wise can a being-well-led become reality in these
  things.
 116) A person of your kind (human being) shall never be placed under a yoke, never become a slave to the next
  one or to the authority, but shall undertake his or her duty without rebuke or compulsion in freedom, even if
  the fellow human beings or the authority do not like to countenance it.
 117) The light of the truth is concealed by those who slaughter their next ones and yet argue about it in order to
  gain their own profit from it.
 118) Do not beat the fallible ones, the criminals, the thieves, liars, deceivers and adulterers, and do not kill (murder)
  the manslayers (murderers) as a punishment for the crime committed on the killed (murdered), rather practise
  equitableness (fairness) and demand atonement in application of the laws and recommendations of the primal
  power (Creation) which are not directed towards revenge, hatred and retaliation but rather towards forbear-
  ance, forgiveness, reconciliation and benevolence (humanity), therefore every punishment shall only be given
  in true humaneness, without harming life and limb, but so that the fallible ones understand the signs (warn-
  ings) of the atonement and may rue the deed.
  119) Your love and humaneness are hardened like stones and even harder, however the hardness must be softened
so that kindheartedness, love and humaneness are able to break forth once more with the effect that virtues,
respect for life and equitableness (fairness) may flow forth and all anxiety, submissiveness and fear will escape
from the thoughts and feelings; therefore it is important not to be heedless in all one's doings.
  120) If it is expected that the word of the truth of the teaching of the spirit and the formation-given (Creation-given)
truth of the laws and recommendations will be accepted, then this is only an expectation because the truth is
not readily accepted, but is twisted because it is not understood or is uncomfortable, although the conse-
quences of this will not fail to appear.
  121) Whenever the ones who have knowledge about the real truth are met then the unknowing ones and those
without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) say that the knowing ones only wanted
to reveal and disclose and argue about things that they themselves could not understand and that it was in
any case far from the truth and reality.
  122) The unknowing ones and those without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) do not
know that they are revealing to the knowing ones what they are hiding through foolish talk.
  123) Vast numbers of people of your kind (human beings) are untaught and do not know the words of the teaching
of the spirit, the teaching of the life and the teaching of the truth, but only their own needs, desires (vices/
wantonness/pathological cravings/drives) and wishes, and they simply assume and do not find the core of the
things, of the reality and of the truthfulness.
  124) Woe betide those who steal the teaching of the proclaimers, the prophets, and write their own books using
it, lying that these are their own teachings and that they only want to take a paltry price for this; therefore
woe betide them on behalf of what they steal and write in lies, and it will go ill with them because of the price
that they fraudulently extract, because ill-gotten goods never prosper for long, it being unavoidable that lies
will come to the light of the truth.
  125) The thieves and liars of the books and writings of the proclaimers, the prophets, fallaciously believe that they will
not be touched by the fire of atonement and woe, or if so then only for a small number of days; but they do not
receive any permission or promises for their shameful doing, which is why they will have to give account for their
activities sooner or later and atone for their actions; and truly they do not know what an outrage they are com-
mitting.
  126) Truly, whoever does bad things and gets entangled in their misdeeds will not be happy of the life and makes
themselves guilty for all the things done that are unright; but it is important not to dwell therein but to liberate
oneself therefrom.
  127) The knowing ones and those who do good works and live according to the laws and recommendations of the
primal power (Creation), they are the ones who are living in equitableness (living in fairness/responsibility) and
they shall remain in this.
  128) There is an unwritten bond between you and the primal raising (Creation) and it shall be kept in honour and
dignity, so that all life, the appearance (nature), the world and the universe may be respectfully honoured and
protected.
  129) No god and no tin god shall be prayed to, because only the vast primal raising (Creation) is the unmeasurable
secret from which all being originated.
  130) You shall show kindheartedness to your parents, brothers and sisters, children, relatives, to the poor and the
orphaned and to all fellow human beings; and you shall talk graciously to the people of your kind (human
beings) and spread the teaching of the truth, give alms (gifts) and not turn away from all these duties and from
the carrying of your responsibility for all and everything with unwillingness, and those who do this neverthe-
less bring down ignominy and guilt onto their heads (mental-block = consciousness, thoughts, feelings and
psyche).
  131) People of your kind (human beings) of Earth, you are people who slaughter your own brothers and sisters and
drive some of your own out of their houses, and the one supports the other in his or her doing shamefully
through misdeeds and ignominy against the disadvantaged.
  132) You shall not spill the blood of your own, not that of your spouse, nor that of your own children, brothers and
sisters, relatives, friends, acquaintances and of the fellow human beings, just as you shall not spill the blood of
those who are thieves and deceivers, murderers, adulterers or other criminals or those without equitableness
(inequitable ones/irresponsible ones/unfair ones), and also you shall not harm them physically or drive them out
of their houses.
  133) You praise and endorse the criminal activities of the lawbreakers who, as judges, demand the death as atone-
ment, and those who practise torture and killing (murder) on condemned evildoers, because you do not con-
sider that you are acting unlawfully against the laws of the primal power (Creation).
  134) Many know about the truth of the laws of the Creation (creational laws) and the need to follow them, but
very many doubt them and turn to an invented god or tin god in order to pay homage to it (glorify it), pray to
it and ask it for gifts, grace and benevolence, which it however cannot grant because it does not exist.
135) Therefore there is no happy reward for those amongst you who do evil, pray to a god or tin god, because they
 give themselves over to the guilt of the abject worship of a divinity thought up by people of your kind (human
 beings) or of a tin god, from which they only harvest anxiety and fear as their ultimate reward.
136) Those who do not respect the current life and throw it away, whether through clear self-killing (suicide) or out of carelessness, are devoid of all rationality and of the knowledge, because they are destroying learning opportu-
nities for their swelling (evolution) of their inner world (consciousness development) which they will have to work
on again in a new life as a new all-of-themself (personality) through arduous learning, therefore the arduousness
of learning is not reduced by this, rather they destroy their own initiative for their own learning opportunity.
137) There were many proclaimers, prophets, who in truth brought the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life, and representatives followed in their footsteps who explained the evident signs
 (proofs) of the truth of the prophets and bore witness to their truthfulness, but you did not want to listen to
 them, neither to the prophets nor to the representatives; so, every time that a herald of the truth-teaching
 comes to you, which is something you yourselves do not wish for, do you want to be arrogant and continue to
 insult the proclaimers, prophets, their representatives and the other heralds of the teaching of the truth calling
 them liars, treating them as deceivers and strike them dead?
138) Truly, your senses and your rationality and your intellect are wrapped in shrouds because you curse yourselves
 for the sake of your unknowledge, because what you really know is only very little.
139) You plead for fulfilment of what you want to have, and you plead to be victorious over those whom you assume
 (deem) to be your enemies because you do not understand that you shall not appoint any others to be your
 enemies, and nevertheless you do not restrain yourselves from doing this; when you are granted what you
 wish, then you throw it away again and bring down bane on your heads (mental-block = consciousness,
 thoughts, feelings and psyche).
140) Bad is that for which you sell your honour and dignity because you reject, disregard and tread underfoot the
 truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), for which reason no grace will be
 bestowed on your heads and nothing can come to you which will make you really happy and full of gladness;
 therefore you only bring down Gewalt and rage upon rage and anger upon anger on yourselves in order finally
 to deteriorate into blind submissiveness and to depart from the life as unknowing ones and ones without equi-
 tableness (unfair ones/inequitable ones/irresponsible ones).
141) And if you are told that you shall know everything about what had been given since time immemorial through
 the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, then you do not want to know it
 hereafter when you are taught it, although it is the truth and everything is affirmed by the reality.
142) Why do you harm and slaughter your proclaimers, your prophets, who bring you the teaching of the truth,
 teaching of the life, teaching of the spirit, if you believe yourselves to be so knowing and human; and truly it
 has been since time immemorial only the real proclaimers, the prophets, who taught you the truth, but you
 preferred to listen to the false priests of your imaginary god, your tin gods, so you have fallen prey to them in
 worship and have become malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth of the fruitfulness (Creation) and
 its laws and recommendations.
143) Bad is that for which people of your kind (human beings) have sold your prosperity and adversity, namely for
 a suppliant and abject belief in an invented and non-being divinity and in tin gods of all kinds to whom you
 pay homage because you do not recollect the manifest teaching of the truth of the proclaimers, the prophets,
 who brought their teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life to everyone and will continue to bring it to
 those who want to hear and learn it; and because things are done in this wise, you bring down anger upon
 anger on your heads from out of yourselves and punish yourselves through lovelessness, unpeace, unfreedom,
 joylessness, lying, cheating and inequality (disharmony).
144) When you are told that you shall be knowing in the real truth, then you lie that you are knowing and that you
 understand the truth, however only in order to curse the knowledge about it hereafter, although the real truth
 is the actual truth that is affirmed by the laws of the primal power (Creation) and natural laws, from which all
 existence of everything existing has originated; therefore you prefer to slay the proclaimers, the prophets, of
 the truth-teaching rather than being honest to yourselves and to people of your kind (fellow human beings)
 and turning yourselves to the eternal truth.
145) Many a proclaimer, prophet, came to you with manifest signs (marvels) which you however disregarded mali- ciously and imperiously, and therefore you committed an outrage against the truth and continue to do so
today, because you have fallen into the worship of divinities and tin gods which neither possess rationality nor
intellect nor the slightest fibre of might so that they could not even make one hair on your heads turn grey.
146) Remember the teaching of the proclaimers, the prophets, and hold fast to that what they have given to you,
 and listen to their teaching of the real truth, so you understand that you have to raise yourselves up to the
 truth and obey yourselves in this truth so that you set yourselves free from the unknowledge, do not impose
 any belief on yourselves and turn to the knowledge of the truth in order to attain wisdom and true love.
147) The dwelling of the impalpable (other world) is only for the consistency of the spirit, however not for the per- son, because this is extinguished after dying in order to give energy and power to a new person who will be
born when the spirit-body (spirit-form) once again returns in a body of people of your kind (human body); therefore do not call for death in order to find in it a release from earthly anguish, because death extinguishes the person for all time and it can never again be made living.
148) And death shall never be called upon in the hope that an existence at the side of a god or in a paradise (realm
 of gods and tin gods) might be a joyful life, because such teachings have no truth and are only the delusions
 of the brain of false priests, proclaimers and prophets who have misled you into senselessness because they
 obtain advantages, relevance and benefits from it.
149) If you are truthful then search for the real truth and call for it for the sake of what the proclaimers, the
 prophets, have said to you in advance concerning knowledge regarding the teaching, so that you do not
 remain malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth, but that you turn to it.
150) Amongst you, the ones who are most greedily searching for life are the ones who are only striving for enjoy-
 ment, vice, amusement, stinginess, revelry, indulgence, pathological craving, salaciousness, gorging, gluttony
 and desires, vices (wantonness/pathological cravings/urges) and who do not pay heed to the real truth nor to
 fulfilment of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation); and indeed every one of you
 wishes in his or her greedy activities to be granted one thousand years of life, in which case, however, you do
 not consider that even the granting of such a life would not protect you from your own atonement if you do
 not fulfil the sense of the life that is given in the swelling (evolution) of the inner world (consciousness) and
 the accumulation of love, knowledge, wisdom, peace, freedom and harmony in all things.
151) Whoever is an enemy of the truth that arises from the laws and recommendations of fruitfulness (Creation)
 vilifies (proscribes) not only their fulfilment but also the messages, revelations and guidance of the proclaimers,
 the prophets.
152) Whoever is an enemy of the truth is also an enemy of the laws and recommendations of the primal power
 (Creation), and an enemy of the natural laws as well as an enemy of the proclaimers, the prophets.
153) Truly, the proclaimers, the prophets of the teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the life have
 brought forth manifest signs (marvels/evidence) since time immemorial, and nobody denied their knowledge
 of this other than the wiseacres, the disobedient ones and the liars and slanderers; and as often as they con-
 cluded an agreement with the truth and the teaching then they rejected it again because they are depraved
 and mendacious and truly without knowledge.
154) Even since time immemorial when proclaimers, prophets, came to fulfil what the teaching of the truth as well
 as the principles of the primal power (Creation) demand them to do, very many of those to whom the teaching
 and the truth was given, cast all the knowledge behind them as if the teaching and the truth had never been
 announced (proclaimed) to them.
155) Many of them followed the way that they pursued under the dominance of agitators against the teaching of
 the truth and the teaching of the spirit as well as the teaching of the life; and it was agitators who remained
 in the unknowledge and taught the people deception and falsehood.
156) And it was representatives to whom it was revealed by the proclaimers, the prophets, to instruct the unknowing ones and put them to the test and say that they shall not remain ones who have no knowledge of the truth.
157) The proclaimers, the prophets, taught their representatives and the people that no one shall do harm to any
 other and that a distinction shall be made between man and woman in many things, but that both shall
 accompany one another in life with the same right, with the same entitlement and in equality, as is given by
 the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation).
158) It was and is taught that everything shall be desisted from which does harm and gives no benefit; whoever
 acquires such things nevertheless will not have any joyful portion in life; but it is true that so many sell their
 happiness and their gladness for awful things, for scum and all the terrible things of the world because
 knowledge and truth is abhorrent to them.
159) If you would have known and acted rightly then the reward for your present existence would certainly have
 been better; and your life reward would be better if you turned to the real truth and therefore to the primal
 power (Creation) and acted rightly.
160) Oh, you have fallen into belief and you say that the untruth is good, but know and hear that only truth and the true knowledge are good, whereas untruth and unknowledge only bring painful hardship and affliction.
161) Those who are unknowing amongst the people, in the writing of the truth-teaching and amongst those who
 place divinities and tin gods beside the primal power (Creation), they all do not wish that good is sent down
 on all those who in truth have knowledge of the teaching of the truth; but the truth chooses boon and
 unmeasurable grace for those who are knowing of the truth.
162) Whatever signs (teaching/evidence and marvels) the proclaimers, the prophets, abrogate or allow to fall into forgetfulness, in their place they bring forth better or equivalent ones according to the new time, because the
new times demand expansions to the teaching of the truth and the signs (evidence and marvels); you namely
become more intelligent and expand your knowledge, which is why the teaching of the truth, teaching of the
spirit, teaching of the life must be given more extensively and in greater detail in accordance with the new time
and the new understanding; however, what does not change is the truth-content of the teaching because the
truth is eternal and unchanging; and the true prophets have the might to do everything in order to carry out the teaching as they consider right; however, protect yourselves from false proclaimers, false prophets who simulate wisdom but are actually less knowing than children and have fallen into the belief in some divinity or other or tin gods.
163) Do you not know that the domain of the firmament (universe) and of the earths (worlds/planets) belongs to
 the primal power (Creation) alone, but that you are set above all as governors, as protectors and helpers for
 yourselves, for all life and everything existing?
164) Do you want to ask your proclaimers, your prophets, as the knowing ones and the wise ones asked them be-
 fore, in order to avoid entering in unknowledge into an exchange with a belief in divinities and tin gods, and
 in order not to err in doubt from the right way?
165) Many of the people who are not favourably disposed to the writing of the truth and to the truth wish in the
 enviousness of their nature – although the teaching of the truth has been clearly announced (proclaimed) to
 them – that they could discourage those of you who are yourselves knowing in the writing of the truth and
 the truth itself from your cognition of the truth and following of the truth, in order to change you back into
 ones unknowing of the truth; but do not be angry because of this and forgive them by proclaiming to them
 that it is your decision not to deviate from the truth and not to turn away from them, because you continue
 to be connected to them in love; you have the might to do so.
166) Do your duty and fulfil your responsibility which can only be carried by yourselves and not by a god or tin gods on your behalf; therefore also give alms (gifts) to the people in need and send out goodness from yourselves,
because you will find it again as thanks from those to whom you give your help; and truly, your goodness and
your help will be appreciated, because the people of your kind (human beings) will see what you are doing.
167) The believers in a god and in tin gods say that believers in other things who are not of their belief will not enter
 the firmament's paradise (realm of gods and tin gods), but such talk only represents fallible teachings and vain
 wishes of those who are going into confusion in the belief and erroneously hope that a god or tin god might
 live in a firmament's paradise (realm of gods and tin gods); indeed this is an evil, fallacious teaching for which
 the in-the-belief fallible ones can never provide truthful evidence.
168) Whoever entirely falls in line with the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) and the laws
 of appearance (nature) will receive an appropriate reward for all time in equitableness (fairness) and will have
 no anxiety and not be afraid, nor will they fall into false sorrow.
169) The ones who believe in a god and tin gods say that people who believe otherwise have no basis for their be-
 lief, and the ones who believe otherwise say that the others have no basis for their belief, although they both
 read the writings of their respective belief which all say that they shall also be equivalent and tolerant in belief;
 and in accordance with their speaking, so spoke those already who did not have any knowledge of the writings,
 therefore they judged fallibly amongst themselves because they were disunited amongst themselves.
170) And who is more inequitable (more irresponsible/more unfair) than those who pile dishonour and ignominy on
 their next ones in belief in a god or tin gods; they are the same as the inequitable ones (unfair ones) who pre-
 vent the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) from being taught through
 the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because they are striving to destroy
 it; and truly, it is not appropriate to do such a thing because it is without respect and an ignominy in this world;
 but those who do such a thing will not reap any good reward.
171) To you on the earth-roundness is given the east, the west, the south and the north, and wherever you turn,
 and therefore the real truth of the principles of the primal power (Creation) and natural principles which is to
 be found in an unlimited wise; pay attention to it and make it your own, then it will go well with you.
172) Everything in the firmaments (universe) and on earths (worlds/planets) is the work of the Creation, but it has
 made it for you to be yours so that you might control everything respectfully, guide everything correctly and
 do everything for your own benefit and that of everything living and otherwise existing; therefore everything
 in the firmaments (universe) and on earth (Earth) has been given to you as your own, for you to care for well
 and protect so that nothing turns into the spilling of blood or into destruction through getting very badly out
 of the control of the good human nature.
173) The Creation alone is the creation of the firmaments (universe) and of the earths (worlds/planets); it formed
 the idea from which everything became.
174) The unknowing ones ask why their god or their tin god does not speak to them, does not appear to them face
 to face and does not give them any signs (miracles), but this was already how those people spoke who were
 not connected to the truth before you, because they did not comprehend (recognise) and did not understand
 the truth and the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) as you do not comprehend them;
 the questions by the old and new unknowing ones are the same, because they did not understand the signs
 (teaching/evidence and marvels) given by the prophets, although these were made obvious for everyone so
 that they would be understood; however, they did not understand because they were trapped by their belief
 in god and tin gods, and went into confusion just as you also in the time of the current day go into confusion
 as ones without knowledge of the truth, which is why you shall learn from the prophets.
 175) The proclaimers, the prophets, sent themselves with the truth, as bringers of good news and as warners; and they confront you and explain to you the truth-teaching so that you might understand it and know that the
 shadow world (hell) is no place of the evil one(the devil) and of demons, but the condition of your own feeling.
 176) No one who has any belief whatsoever in a divinity or in a tin god will be satisfied with you, unless you follow
  their belief; truly, however, your guidance is solely the guidance of the truth coming from the Creation, there-
  fore do not follow the false cognisance or the cravings of those who go in falseness and erroneously teach the
  untruth, otherwise you will find neither true friends nor honest helpers.
 177) Those to whom the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life has been given and
  who follow it as it shall be followed, they are the ones who know about the real truth; and all those who do
  not know about it are the losers.
 178) Oh you people of your kind (human beings), think about the laws and recommendations of the Creation that
  have been explained by the prophets since time immemorial and are still bestowed upon you today so that you
  rise above yourselves in the knowledge about the truth and become true people of your kind (human beings)
  and peoples.
 179) And consider that when you are put to the test by the proclaimers, the prophets, through the laws and recom-
  mendations, then consider that they are the true leaders for you, of today and tomorrow and for all descend-
  ants, irrespective of whether they live in equitableness (fairness/responsibility) or in inequity (irresponsibility/
  unfairness).
 180) Build up a house here and there as a meeting place for yourselves so that you have a place of refuge for learn -
  ing the truth and the truth-teaching; and take any place for this which appears suitable and keep it clean of
  all evil for all people who turn it into peace and freedom and for those who stay there in contemplation of the
  truth and Creation, and for those who say prayers to their spirit (i.e. consciousness) therein.
 181) The laws of the primal power (laws of the Creation) and recommendations of the primal power (recommen-
  dations of the Creation) require that you make each place into a place of peace and freedom and love and
  consonance (harmony); and supply all inhabitants of all places with fruits and other nourishments, both those
  who are knowing and those who are unknowing; but keep your descendants' numbers within limits so that
  no hunger, suffering, hatred, vice or any evil disasters originate and there is no destruction wrought on the
  world, its appearance (nature) and the world of animals and other creatures (birds, fishes, reptiles, etc.) and on
  the air, on the waters and the weather; and do good deeds for all people of your kind (human beings) for all
  time, and no one shall be driven into the fire of hardship, because this is not a destiny.
 182) Build the foundation walls of your knowledge on the real truth of the principles and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) as well as on the natural laws because you are destined as the fulfillers of those.
 183) The prophets teach you that you shall turn to the real truth and keep your descendants' numbers within limits
  as is given to you through the laws of rationality that you shall follow by not taking the way of believing in
  divinities and tin gods, but the way of the truth because you are the ones who must turn to yourselves in kind-
  heartedness and give yourselves benevolence.
 184) The proclaimers, the prophets, have always awakened themselves since time immemorial from the midst of
  their people, and they shall also do so in the time to come; and they have given you signs (teaching/evidence
  and marvels) of the truth, and they will continue to proclaim signs (evidence) of the truth and teach the writing
  of wisdom, so that you will cleanse yourselves of your unknowledgeness and you will be the mighty ones and
  the wise ones on Earth, who follow the truth-teaching.
 185) You shall not turn away from the knowledge and the wisdom of the prophets, unless you are of misguided
  senses and erroneously assume (believe) that you have been chosen in better knowledge and by the world to
  spread fallacious teachings, by which you however put yourselves in the unright and you will certainly be the
  ones without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones).
 186) Connect yourselves with the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation), to
  be a true human being and the true master of your life.
 187) Oh you people of your kind (human beings), in truth the primal wellspring (Creation) has chosen the knowl-
  edge, the wisdom and the swelling (growth/evolution) of your inner world (consciousness) for you through its
  laws and recommendations, so that you may fulfil the sense of the life and death does not overtake you
  through belief and in the state of being devoted to a god or tin gods, and therefore in unknowledge and
  unwisdom.
 188) True prophets were with many peoples, that have since passed away, and they received what they merited,
  and it will be the same with you at your passing away; therefore you shall heed the word and teaching of the
  true prophet so that you will not be appraised according to those deeds as were connected to the peoples
  already passed away according to their merits.
 189) Do not be believers in divinities or tin gods, but be knowing ones in creational truth so that you are led cor-
  rectly; therefore do not follow a belief, but only the truth, the one made known since time immemorial by the
  prophets who were not false like those who set up divinities and tin gods beside the primal wellspring
  (Creation).
  190) Know about the truth of the primal wellspring (Creation), the only one, and what has been revealed to you by
the proclaimers, the prophets, of its laws and recommendations; therefore make no distinction between the
words of one proclaimer, prophet, and another proclaimer, prophet, because their teaching of the truth is a
single teaching although one that has been repeatedly re-explained in accordance with your intellect, and so
that the teaching will be continuously expanded in each new time, newly explained and presented; and the
last proclaimer, prophet, from the one line will explain the truthly teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
spirit, the teaching of the life in the greatest of detail, in the last sequence, which will be in a unique wise,
after which the line of the proclaimers, the line of the prophets, will end and not be resumed again.
  191) And if you are knowing then you are truly led; if, however, you turn back then you will cause a splitting in yourselves, so that you will certainly no longer satisfy equitableness (fairness) and the present existence, be-
  cause then you are the all-deepening ones (all-hearing ones) of a belief and set against better knowledge.
  192) Accept the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the laws and recommendations of formation (Creation); and
who is a better teacher of the truth-teaching than the true prophets who are familiar with the laws and recom-
mendations of the primal power (Creation) which they have learned since time immemorial!
  193) Do not quarrel amongst yourselves about the real truth, because the truth is given by the laws of the power
of origination (Creation) and is unchangeable; and the power of origination (Creation) alone is the great might
and the unmeasurable secret beside which you shall not place any gods or tin gods; solely the power of origi-
nation (Creation) is the highest one above you and it has done its great works from which all firmaments (the
universe) and all life originated, therefore do your works so that from you great things may also come forth as
greatness and good things as goodness; and be upright in your doings so that you are not malefactors; there-
fore honour the name of the Creation, so that you do not misuse it.
  194) Do you know that all people of your kind (human beings) were always people of your kind (human beings),
both the believers in divinities and tin gods as well as the ones who have knowledge of the truth about the
Creation?; or do you believe that you know it better than the prophets who are connected only to the truth?;
and consider that you are without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) if you con-
ceal the prophets' evidence of the truth, and that your wrong doings will not go unheeded.
  195) It is taught that the old peoples passed away according to their merit, which was of a negative sense and
wrong value, because they concealed and disregarded the truth-teaching; do not do the same, so that you will
not be asked about their deeds and not made equivalent to them.
  196) If you do the same as the old peoples who passed away according to their merits by falling away from the
truth, then you will be asked why you have turned away from the true truth-teaching which you had however
followed; therefore you are surely well-led on the right path, in the east, west, south and north, if you pay your
tribute to the truth.
  197) The laws of the primal wellspring (laws of the Creation) determine that you shall raise yourselves up into
peoples and shall live together in peace, love, freedom and in concord (harmony) with one another, and you
shall be guardians of these values; and no laws shall be applied according to which malefactors (lawbreakers),
doers of misdeeds and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) shall be subjected to punishments which harm
their life and limb, in other words neither torture nor the threat of death nor their execution, because the inner
feeling (psyche) and life and limb of the people of your kind (human beings) must remain inviolate; it is not
the wise of the primal wellspring (Creation) nor of its laws and recommendations for human beings to be har-
med in their inner feeling (psyche) or their life and limb, because punishment shall only be imposed in the form
of taking measures for separation from the people (society) for a certain duration; in the world of your
thoughts and your feelings you shall be compassionate and kindhearted towards all life and be fearless in your
knowledge about the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation).
  198) Often, you turn your face towards the firmament and look up to the stars where you are searching for your
gods and tin gods, but they are not there because they are only the delusions of your brains; truly, however, if
you look to the firmament and onto Earth and at everything that creeps and flies thereon, then you will see
the great and vast work of the primal wellspring (Creation), the only one; therefore turn your face (eyes) to all
that the primal wellspring (Creation) has created and has been maintaining since time immemorial, because
only that is the truth and reality; and wherever you may be, turn your face to the miracles (outstanding things)
of the primal wellspring (Creation) so that you recognise the truth and also the writing of the truth that is given
to you and one day will be given to you in detail as a valueful book when the last prophet of the one line brings
it forth in all comprehensiveness and gives it to you; and he will teach you the truth-teaching like none other
before, and therefore the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life will not go
unheeded in future because the doings of the last prophet will be outstanding without measure.
  199) The last prophet brings the writing of the truth-teaching as well as all signs (marvels/evidence) of his power
and the real truth which you shall follow; if you do not follow the real truth then you are following delusional
teachings, their false cognisance and wishes; then you are truly without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsi-
ble ones/inequitable ones).
200) The rational ones amongst you to whom the writing of the teaching of the truth is given, recognise it as the truth
 just as they recognise their own children; others however are irrational because they knowingly (consciously)
 conceal the truth.
201) All truth is in the Creation and in its laws and recommendations, therefore do not create your own and false
 truth in yourselves, otherwise you are turning yourselves into people without equitableness (unfair ones/irre-
 sponsible ones/inequitable ones) and into doubters.
202) Everyone has a determination towards which they strive, therefore compete with one another in good works
 so that you complete great things wherever you may be; combine together to perform great works, then you
 have the might to do and achieve everything that you strive for; however, always use and do everything in
 goodness so that you do not end up as people without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable
 ones).
203) And wherever you come from, turn your face (eyes) towards the truth so that no abnormal doubt arises in you
 against it and your doings are not heedless.
204) And wherever you go, turn your face (eyes) towards the truth, and wherever you are, also turn your face
 towards it there; if you do so, then the ones living in equitableness (fairness and responsibility) will have no
 objection towards you, excepting those amongst them who wallow in inequity (irresponsibility/unfairness),
 who lie and deceive and do everything to harm you; however do not fear them but only be afraid of denying
 the truth so that goodness can be perfected in you and so that you are rightly led.
205) Just as the proclaimers, the prophets, came to you out of your midst announcing the signs (teaching/evidence)
 of the truth and bringing them forth, so you will be cleansed from unknowledge and inequity (unfairness/ir-
 responsibility) if you follow the teaching that is given by the proclaimers, the prophets, and by the writing of the
 truth, which teaches you what you need to know.
206) Therefore think about the truth that is presented and explained to you by the proclaimers, the prophets, who
 think of you in love, therefore thank them and do not be unthankful to them.
207) Oh you, who are knowing in the truth, search for help in the learning of the truth-teaching and in patience,
 because truly there is a boon upon your head (mental-block = consciousness, thoughts, feelings and psyche)
 if you go forth in steadfastness.
208) And do not say about those who have been slain for the truth that they had fallen into foolishness, because
 truly they were in good senses, but they were not understood and were slandered due to their love for the
 truth by those who wallow in inequity (irresponsibility/unfairness) and truth-deniers; and the ones slain for the
 truth were alive in their nature and in their inner world (consciousness), but those who wallow in inequity (irre-
 sponsibility/unfairness) and the truth-deniers were living dead.
209) Truly, you will all be tested by the appearance (nature) with anxiety and fear, hunger and loss of your goods
 and chattels and life and all that which is of nourishment, but when you are connected to patience then you
 will surely overcome all tests, because it is part and parcel of the life for things to go up and down, for good
 to alternate with bad, of which there can be no doubt; the message to the patient ones is, however, that all
 strivings yield good fruits and time will ultimately change everything to the good.
210) The believers say when unfortune strikes them that it is the will of their divinity or of their tin gods, however
 because there is no determining divinity and also no determining tin gods then neither their ministration nor
 retaliation exists, because in all things you alone are the determining factor in the carrying out of your own
 responsibility.
211) However, the unknowing ones and those who wallow in inequity (irresponsibility/unfairness) have fallen into
 belief and are looking for their salvation in divinities and tin gods, and hoping that these will drip grace and
 blessing onto their heads because they believe they are rightly led.
212) Certainly, the prophets' signs (marvels) of the truth appear to be miracles (outstanding things), but they are a
 creation of the might of their own inner world (consciousness), and therefore it is no ignominy for them to
 perform signs (marvels); however those who learn the talent of giving signs from the prophets and use this for
 their own gain in order to dazzle and to obtain advantages (benefits) and profit from it, they are the ones who
 are exposing themselves to ignominy and are burdening themselves with unright.
213) And it is no ignominy for those who care for the truth and travel to places where the truth-teaching is revealed;
 and therefore it is no ignominy, but a good work, if good is done beyond the limits of duty; and therefore it
 is no ignominy if help is bestowed on the truth-teaching in any wise so that it can spread amongst you; how -
 ever, it is not rightful to make commerce for profit out of the truth-teaching, and it is also not rightful to pros -
 elytise and persuade for the truth-teaching and to impose it onto the unknowing ones and to attack them in
 their thoughts and feelings; human beings shall only come to the real truth through their own will, in the need
 of their demand and in complete freedom of their thinking in honest striving for the real truth and sense of
 the life.
214) Those wallowing in inequity (irresponsibility/unfairness) and the unknowing ones amongst you falsify what the prophets bring in the truth-teaching, in signs (marvels/evidence) and in the guideline (sign-posting/leading
thought) when they teach it to you through word and writing; and you curse the prophets, and in hatred also
the people of your kind (human beings) all around, nevertheless the prophets forgive you but the people you have cursed amongst the people of your kind (human beings) do not forgive you and curse you also.
215) You, however, if you feel sorry and you improve yourselves and profess yourselves open to the truth, you will
 be representatives of the prophets, so that you shall pass on the recognised truth to all those who ask about
 it; however you shall not proclaim your wisdom unasked and not attack other people with it, such as the
 believers do who have become a slave to divinities and tin gods.
216) And if you regret your unknowledge and your inequity (unfairness) and improve yourselves and profess your-
 selves open to the truth-teaching, then you must forgive yourselves because you alone are the forgiving ones
 for yourselves when you have found the path to the truth and freedom, to peace, to love and to consonance
 (harmony) in yourselves and have thereby created a living hoard in yourselves.
217) Those, however, who are unknowing ones and ones wallowing in inequity (irresponsibility/unfairness) and eke
 out an existence as such, they curse themselves all-in-all because their present existence becomes an unjoy and,
 sooner or later, a torment.
218) But those who are distressed by unjoy and torment shall not remain so, because they shall moderate their own
 punishment that they have imposed on themselves and come to recognition if they turn to the truth of the
 Creation and its laws and recommendations and fulfil them.
219) And there is no god, no one god, and there is no tin god, no one tin god, who is favourable and benevolent,
 because god and tin god are inventions and lies and delusions of the brain of people of your kind (the human
 brain) and are of no use in any good wise whatsoever, except in evil for enslaving the people of your kind
 (human beings) through the mendacity of the priests serving god and tin gods, through whom their believers
 are subjugated and exploited.
220) Truly, in the Creation of the firmaments (universe) and the earth-roundnesses (worlds/planets) and in the
 change from day and night and in the flying machines which fly through the air and the skies, and in the ships
 which travel over the seas, lakes and rivers carrying everything that is useful to you, and in the water (rain) that
 falls from the firmament and invigorates Earth, and scattered over it the people of your kind (human beings)
 and all kinds of animals and other creatures, and in the change of the weather and the winds and the clouds
 which float between the firmament and Earth, and the sun in the sky and the stars and the moon in the firma-
 ment at night; all of these are real signs of the truthly Creation which stands as an unmeasurable secret above
 all life, above all firmaments (universe) and above all earths (worlds/planets); and they are signs (evidence) for
 everyone who recognises the truth and understands it, who turns to it and forms their present existence with
 it.
221) However, there are others amongst you who have set up a divinity or a tin god or an object of worship for
 themselves because they are unknowing in the truth of the primal raising (Creation) and love their god or tin
 gods or object as if it were living and truthful; and they are sick in their belief and without rationality, because
 they are unable to distinguish between their delusion and the truth of reality; they are malefactors (irresponsi-
 ble ones) against the truth, and if they could see themselves as malefactors (lawbreakers) and understand it
 then they would realise the hardship and the misery and the punishment that they themselves are imposing in
 themselves and which never comes from the primal raising (Creation) or from outside.
222) If those who lead you in a delusional belief in a god or tin gods then cut themselves off from you, then you
 are helpless as motherless lambs, because all your bonds have been cut to your leaders who keep you in the
 servitude (bondage) of belief.
223) And you who follow your false leaders of an untrue truth, in belief in a god or tin gods, you are afraid of turn-
 ing back to the truth because you believe that you would deny your own god or tin gods as you are denying
 the real truth; however, if you turn around and turn yourselves towards the truth, then you will recognise the
 truth of origination (Creation) and its works, therefore you would free yourselves from your anguish and from
 the fire of self-punishment.
224) Eat of everything that serves you as food on Earth, fruits, vegetables and meat, of every fruit and every berry,
 of all herbs and of all animals and creatures of every kind and of everything that tastes good to you, because
 nothing is banned (forbidden), rather everything is allowed to you that tastes good to you and is not poisonous
 to you; if however someone forbids you from doing this, then they are not doing rightfully, are your obvious
 enemy and are contradicting the laws of origination (Creation) and the truth-teaching; they only bid you to do
 evil and disgraceful things, which contradict the laws of the primal wellspring (Creation) and that you speak ill
 of the truth and of things that you do not know.
225) And all of those amongst you who are knowing in real truth, eat of all good things that are given to you
 through the laws of formation (Creation) and of appearance (nature) on Earth; be thankful for everything that
 you receive because the goodness and the benevolence of the creative (Creation) and of the appearance
 (nature) created by it are vast and without end.
226) You shall only be prohibited from nourishing yourselves with things that have themselves perished and are rot- ten and therefore are inedible; given to you are all edible and non-poisonous fruits and vegetables, all fermented
juices (alcohol such as wine, beer, spirits, etc.) and all the meat of all animals and other creatures from which
you wish to eat, from the small rodent, from the rabbit, the goat, the sheep and the pig, cattle, the horse and the camel and everything that tastes good to you, but always in a tolerable and healthy quantity without gorg - ing or gluttony; the animals and other creatures, rodents, rabbits, goats and sheep, pigs and cattle, horses and camels and everything that is edible may appear unclean externally because they live in dirt, but on the inside they are clean and good, therefore they may serve as nourishment once the outside is cleaned of dirt; also the blood of the animals and other creatures may serve as nourishment in some cases, and the fermented juice (alcohol such as wine, beer, spirits, etc.) shall only be enjoyed in a small measure so that no drunkenness obscures the senses; therefore the measure shall not be exceeded in any things and obedience shall be practised in all things so that all nourishment serves the bodily good and health.
227) And if it is said to you that you shall follow the teaching of the prophets, then you do not want to follow the
 call and say that you want to hurry after what was found existing since time immemorial in the belief in divini-
 ties and tin gods; however, as your talk is like this, even your fathers and mothers did not have any intellect
 and did not walk on the right way.
228) And those who are unknowing and have fallen into inequity (unfairness/irresponsibility) are like a man who is
 calling to something that cannot hear and cannot see anything, is deaf, blind and dumb and does not perceive
 any call or any cry.
229) Those amongst you who falsify and deny any part whatsoever of what is given through the laws of the cre-
 ative (Creation) and of the teaching of the true prophets and their truthly writings, and those who accept the
 slander (calumny) in exchange for a miserable price, they are filling their admonishment (conscience) with
 nothing but fire that devours them inwardly and makes them loveless, inequitable (unfair), unknowing, unfree,
 unpeaceful and unharmonious; they cannot cleanse their admonishment (conscience) and they impose a great
 inner punishment on themselves because they are the ones who barter for an erroneous assumption; and they
 do not know how great is their underestimation of the burning fire of their admonishment (conscience).
230) The proclaimers, the prophets, have indeed brought the writing of the real truth, but nevertheless it is certain
 that you are at odds with the word and the writing of the proclaimers, the prophets; you have gone far in
 enmity and curse and slay the proclaimers, the prophets, who are bringing you the truth-teaching and a true
 life.
231) Equitableness (fairness) is not a matter of you turning your face (eyes) to the east, west, south or north and
 knowing a lot about the world, but only the one who accepts the real truth, the truth of the creative (Creation)
 and its existence in reality, its laws and recommendations and all its inexhaustible works truly lives in equitable-
 ness (fairness); and equitableness (fairness) consists in learning the writing of the proclaimers, the prophets,
 and leading one's present existence in accordance with their truth, in love, peace and freedom and in conso-
 nance (harmony); and equitableness (fairness) consists in giving your surplus gains to the needy and to orphans
 as well as to wayfarers and all those who are obliged to request a charitable donation, or to those who are
 prisoners and who are starving; and equitableness (fairness) is rewarding those who keep their promises and
 do not break their word when they have given their word; and equitableness (fairness) is helping those who
 are patient in their poverty and affliction as well as those who are steadfast in the truth in times of battle (times
 of war) so that they may honestly prove themselves and no longer become thieves, deceivers, murderers and
 the like, and not turn to a god or tin gods in anxiety and fear.
232) Through your belief in gods and tin gods which demand blood, revenge and punishment from you, you be-
 lieve that a right measure of revenge and retaliation has been decreed for you and that you shall shed blood
 and destroy life for those killed (murdered), for adultery and theft and deception, as well as for many other
 things just as the gods and tin gods you have invented command you, therefore it is only revenge and retali-
 ation which you yourselves have invented that is meted out on the fallible ones; indeed, however, the creative
 (Creation) did not issue any such law that a misdeed or bad deed shall be punished by revenge and retaliation
 involving harming the body or taking the life, because the creative (Creation) gave the recommendation that
 you shall not kill in Ausartung; do not kill out of revenge and retaliation, as a punishment, out of hatred or
 jealousy, and also not through robbery, fury and anger, out of greed and avarice and many more besides, be-
 cause it belongs to Ausartung and goes against the creationally given laws and is not worthy of the people of
 your kind (human beings).
233) But you believe in divinities and tin gods to which you have assigned false and delusional mights and claims as well as the instruction and demand for revenge and retaliation and punishment, so retaliation shall be prac-
tised in right measure by free ones for the free, by slaves for the slaves, by woman for the woman and by man
for the man, but this is lies and deception, because no law and no recommendation of the Creation demands
such a thing, but the opposite; punishment for misdeeds and bad deeds shall only be given in accordance with
the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation) which are given in such a wise that no matter
how fallible anyone is they shall not be harmed in life or limb, so every misdeed, fallibility and bad deed of any
type shall be punished in love and humanity, so that every fallible one, every child, every woman and every
man may draw a good lesson from it and turn to the better and good so that reintegration into the people
(society) may be once again possible when the conditions are good for it; if reintegration into the people (soci- ety) is not possible because the criminal or murderous sense of the fallible ones does not change and no ration- ality and no love can be brought forth, as well as no peace and no concord (harmony), then the fallible ones shall be separated from the people (society) for their lifetime and brought to a place of fulfilment of guidelines (place of execution of punishment = island, secluded area, etc.), where they are imprisoned and live in free- dom within the confines and learn, and are provided with all the necessary things for their present existence; places of fulfilment of guidelines shall be secluded areas and islands from which the guilty ones cannot get back to unconfined freedom, but must remain where they are.
234) Be at all times lenient and forgiving in accordance with equitableness (fairness/responsibility/moderate); so it is, if anything is decreed on one by his or her next one or by authority or by the court then the demand for
atonement shall be made with justification and the fallible one shall be taken for punishment through an
equitable (fair/appropriate) conviction, although neither life nor limb is allowed to be harmed; the laws and
recommendations of the Creation are explained so that everyone may learn from everything and promote their
knowledge and their wisdom so that they may become good and follow the laws and recommendations of
the love and of the Creation for their own benefit and to the weal of all, and create everything to the best in
themselves; only those who contravene these laws and recommendations of the Creation commit an outrage
against them and against the truth of the life and against everything that is rightful; and whoever puts them-
selves in the unright and commits an outrage against the truth will meet a painful punishment in themselves
– through lovelessness, discord, unfreedom, unpeace and inequality (disharmony) as well as many things that have a negative sense and wrong value.
235) There is no value in your life in re-retaliation and revenge, because through retaliation and revenge you turn your-
 selves into guilty ones and fallible ones, therefore your acts of retaliation and your desires for revenge must also
 be punished.
236) And you shall practise equitableness (being fair/fairness) in all things, so you also have to observe equitable-
 ness (fairness) between man and woman, because both of you shall be equal and none given precedence,
 therefore the same rights apply to woman as to man; the woman shall not be subservient to the man, and vice
 versa; therefore the man shall not use the woman and her womb in salaciousness and selfishness for fulfilling
 his own pleasure like a field which is ploughed and sown at will for one's own enjoyment; the same rights shall
 prevail amongst and between both sexes also during sexual intercourse, therefore equality in all things applies
 to man and woman just as an equivalent value is given to both in the conjoining of bodies in order to beget
 offspring or for the stimulating and joyful and joining and healing fulfilment of pleasure.
237) And as you shall practise equitableness (being fair/fairness) in all things, so also practise equitableness (being fair)
 to your children because they are no less (inferior) than you, therefore you shall treat them as people of your
 kind (human beings) just as you treat those who are no longer young (are grown-ups) and are not children any
 more.
238) And as you shall practise equitableness (being fair/fairness) in all things, so think about your life and your death
 because after your birth both are unavoidable for you, so that you must ponder them and find the way to both
 in calm and peace; therefore practise equitableness (fairness) on your descendants and relatives because when
 the time comes for you to depart from life you shall have settled everything so that all your left-behind chat-
 tels and your wealth may be distributed in equitableness (fairness); but you few, who are able to write, pre-
 pare a text with instructions on how and to whom your heritable goods, chattels and wealth shall be handed
 over in whichever particular amounts; if you are however unable to write then announce your last will to a
 scribe so that he can record everything in writing which is your final decision; if you leave anything behind,
 then make a writing (testament) before you lay yourself down close to death and make the writing (testament)
 for man, woman and child, for the parents and close relatives or for friends and for whatever you wish, in order
 to act in equitableness (recognition/approval/fairness); when you make the writing (testament) or have it made
 then act in equitableness (fairness) and do not cheat any of those who remain behind so that no discord, bad
 blood and strife or even worse may flare up; and those who remain behind shall not fall prey to avarice and
 not call on the jurisdictions to break the last will of the deceased for their own benefits; and the survivors of
 the deceased shall not be at odds with one another and quarrel over the wealth and chattels, because such
 doings are not worthy of people of your kind (human beings) and are only done by ones without equitable-
 ness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/ones without fairness) and unknowing ones who are reviled by the people
 as scum.
239) And as you shall practise equitableness (fairness) in all things, so also practise equitableness (fairness) in that
 you do not steal, destroy or falsify any writing (testament) that a human being has left behind after his or her
 death in order to settle everything; anyone who does this is committing an outrage against themselves and the
 truth and his or her fellow human beings, and there is never any boon from it; and those who do it will truly
 have a heavy guilt placed on them which they will find difficult to bear.
 240) Truly, however, those who practise equitableness (fairness) and fear that the one who has prepared or had pre-
  pared his or her writing (testament) for after his or her dying and therefore for his or her goods and chattels
  and wealth for the survivors has created partiality or inequity for the survivors through his or her writing (testa-
  ment), that human being shall confront the human being who produced the writing (testament) and show
  (reveal) the correct way to him or her; and if survivors fall into enmity due to partiality and inequity of the
  deceased and his or her writing (testament) then rational people shall bring about peace between those affected
  so that they will be forgiving and compassionate to one another.
 241) You believe that fasting is prescribed for you, and it is maintained that fasting was already prescribed for those
  who have gone before you, but this is by no means the truth because it has been from time immemorial only
  a discourse by those without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) so that you would
  remain with your god or tin god through your belief.
 242) Truly, fasting is no law, although it is a recommendation which serves your health and the well-being of your body so that you do not practise gorging and gluttony and satisfy yourselves with a good measure; therefore,
 according to your own discretion, take a number of days determined by yourselves during which you only con-
 sume moderate nourishment once a day; however, whoever is ill and those who would have difficulty in with-
 standing the fast shall refrain from doing so and do it if it is necessary for them; and fasting does not apply to
 children and those hungering in misery, because they require nourishment and cannot do without it; therefore
 let children and those hungering in misery eat in voluntary observance of the laws and recommendations of the
 primal power (Creation) and do a good work for them; and fasting is good for you if you wish to understand
 it – for your health, for your body and everything that is within it, as well as for your discipline and taming.
 243) And there shall not be any particular time for fasting, but it is a recommendation-given guidance to you that
  fasting shall be performed when the requirement or health stand behind it, therefore they apply as proof of
  direction and differentiation according to which fasting shall be performed; whoever has the want for fasting
  or because his or her health demands it, or because it is given, for whatever reason, he or she may fast for a
  predetermined time depending on his or her own free will or the instruction given by someone versed in
  medicine; however, whoever is suffering from an illness shall not take part in fasting or only do so according
  to the instruction of someone versed in medicine; therefore wish to make it easy and not difficult for your-
  selves and perform fasting according to the necessary extent so that you are rightly led and that you may be
  thankful for it.
 244) And if you are asked about the reason for fasting by the unknowing ones, then say that it is a matter of your
  health and tell the questioner or the requester that they shall listen to the guidance of the recommendations
  for fasting and be knowing in them so that they may walk the right way.
 245) Also in the time of fasting, it is permitted for you to go into your woman or your man if you are rightful in your
  bond with one another (connected to one another); therefore do not act in inequity (unfairness/irresponsibility)
  against yourselves, but be kindhearted and practise equitableness (fairness) on yourselves and grant yourselves
  easement in your union with one another, therefore you may go into one another also during the time of
  fasting and strive for what is sufficient for your good; and eat and drink during the time of fasting in an appro-
  priate minimum extent so that you will not be prevented from fasting due to great hunger; and when you com-
  plete your fasting then the day may return to its given course although you should restrict the amount of nour-
  ishment so that you do not suffer any injury; these are the limits that are given by the recommendations so
  that you do not exceed them and accept them so that you will be protected against everything that harms your
  health and well-being and brings you evil.
 246) And do not devour your wealth amongst one another through falseness and lying and deception, and not through
  greed and stinginess; and do not offer your wealth for bribery, not to those without equitableness (unfair ones/ir -
  responsible ones/inequitable ones) and not to authority in order to be granted advantages and right while in the
  unright, because thereby you knowingly (consciously) wish to devour parts of the wealth of the other people; live
  at all times in equitableness (fairness/responsibility) and honestly and do not dare to commit misdeeds in order
  thereby to increase your wealth by striving to swindle the wealth of others through unright.
 247) As you are the ones living in equitableness (fairness/responsibility), uphold righteousness (conscientiousness) so
  that you do not enter the houses of your next ones from behind as thieves; respect the house and the right
  and the wealth of your next ones so that you do not covet your next one's goods and chattels just as you do
  not covet the wife of your next one or the husband of your next one; therefore, you shall enter the houses
  through the doors that are opened to you so that you may enter honestly and be welcome; and therefore take
  heed of this and respect your next one's goods and chattels and wealth, and honour your next one's wife and
  your next one's husband so that you will always be received in a friendly wise and be honoured guests; be fear-
  ful of the unright so that it may go well with you.
 248) And if you are asked about the purpose of the moon and the stars in the firmament, then teach that the moon
  helps to determine that on Earth which makes possible the tides of the seas and the changes of the weather
  by which everything thrives and lives well.
  249) And if you enter into a bond between man and woman, then both shall have the capabilities for doing so, and
each party shall have sufficient goods and chattels and wealth to bring into the bond as male and female
dowry as is given in accordance with possibility; however, no purchase price shall be paid for a woman or for
a man, because neither the one nor the other is a commodity.
  250) And if your bond of marriage is broken, then separate in honour and do not quarrel, rather divide your goods
and chattels and your wealth fairly in accordance with the earnings as acquired by the woman and the man,
so that the share falls to each party as he or she has worked for, and may he or she be satisfied with it; if one
has more than the other, then the one who owns more may give to the other at his or her discretion; it shall
not be the case that authority or jurisdiction shall make assessments for a settlement and indemnity and the
like if woman and man exercise equality and equitableness (fairness); therefore jurisdiction or authority shall
only make an assessment if a decision has to be reached in a dispute, because man and woman are free in
their bond and also in setting the line about what shall be.
  251) And if a bond of marriage is broken, then a letter of separation shall be written, both by the woman and by
the man so that it is set down in writing that both parties are no longer in a bond and are free and unmarried
and can go their own way; and both man and woman have the same duties and rights in the dissolution of
the bond so that neither the man nor the woman is to be favoured; and goods and chattels as well as posses-
sions and wealth acquired jointly by the man and woman before and during the bond of marriage shall be allo-
cated half to the man and half to the woman in honesty and equitableness (fairness); if there is a dispute be-
tween the man and woman about the allocation when the bond is cancelled and if they cannot jointly find the
way to this then jurisdiction or the authority shall decide based on precise documentary evidence and also clar -
ify the situation in terms of goods and chattels, possessions and wealth in order to reach a wise decision on
this and to do rightfully so that each party receives the share according to his or her earnings or what they
contributed as a dowry, so neither the woman nor the man is cheated; the dowry contributed by the woman
belongs to her, and the dowry contributed by the man belongs to him, both during the bond and also when
a termination of the bond is completed; therefore it shall also be the case that after a termination of the bond
of marriage the woman and the man go their own ways, and also that the woman is not responsible for pay-
ing for the maintenance of the man nor the man for the maintenance of the woman because after separation
from bed and board each party is responsible for providing for their own living and their own maintenance so
that equality and equitableness (fairness) may prevail.
  252) And if a bond of marriage is broken, then neither the woman nor the man shall be preferred in law if jurisdic-
tion or the authority must decide on the break-up of the bond, rather both parties shall be subject to the same
duty and the same right; it is given, if the bond breaks up, that the children shall not be allocated either to the
woman or the man alone for their upbringing and their welfare, rather it shall be that a regulated reciprocity
shall exist so that the children stay alternately for a number of days with the mother and a number of days
with the father, so that the children are not torn in themselves and do not develop any extraneousness towards
one parent, and both parents are responsible for the children; therefore it shall be given that the children are
brought up by both parents, and also that not one parent alone but both parents, namely mother and father,
shall contribute equally to the welfare of the children; if one of the parents can be proved to be doubtful or
incapable in all things relating to the upbringing and care of the children, then the other parent shall take them
into his or her charge and bring them up and provide them with everything necessary, but it is given that they
shall not be withheld from the other parent so that the parental duty can be discharged; and in case of any
malicious violation of this then the fallible parent shall be rebuked by the authority or jurisdiction and sub-
jected to a stern punishment; if both parents can be proved to be incapable of bringing up their children and
supplying them with everything that they require, then a decision shall be reached that they shall live in a suit-
able place similar to where orphans live so that they can receive a good upbringing, love and support; children
are not the property of their parents because they are in their nature free people of your kind (human beings)
with their own thoughts and feelings as well as with the right to decide of their own free will.
  253) And if a bond of marriage is broken and a letter of separation is issued then the woman shall abstain from sensual (sexual) relations with another man for ten months waiting for the monthly menstruation so that no
  concealed pregnancy or offspring may become a burden and an obligation on another man; and if a man and
  woman separate from one another and nevertheless live under the same roof, and the woman approaches the
  end of her waiting period of ten months of monthly menstruation then she may remain in a decorous wise
  under the same roof in accordance with her volition and that of the separated man, or in a decorous wise she
  shall leave the place and go her own way; and this depends on whose property the house is and how the sepa-
  rated man or woman have decided between themselves on where to stay; but neither woman nor man may
  remain in the house contrary to right, so that they do not commit any brutality against one another; and if
  they behave in correctness then truly neither the man nor woman need to carry any burden and guilt; there-
  fore do not mock these recommendations and think of your honour and dignity at all times which you can
carry or may lose; consider the recommendations in wisdom and admonish yourselves always to comply with
them.
  254) And if you have separated from one another as man and woman then you shall not presume to revile the other
party, slander them or do anything bad to them; therefore you shall also not prevent the separated woman or
the separated man from entering into another bond of marriage if the woman or man has agreed with an-
other man or woman in a decorous wise; truly, this recommendation is also an admonition that it will be more
beneficial and more understandable for you when you follow this guideline (sign-posting/leading thought).
  255) And if an honourable woman becomes pregnant and bears offspring then she shall be given all honour and
rights of motherhood and shall be respected, and the child shall enjoy a good upbringing and nourishment;
and no evil is to be done to any woman or any ignominy heaped upon her for what has been created in her
womb, and it shall be that the creators of her fruit admit in honour and undertake all duties by participating
in the education and nourishment and welfare.
  256) And if a bond of marriage is broken and a letter of separation issued, and the man and woman find themselves
together again in reconciliation then they shall be permitted to take one another back and enter into a new
bond of marriage with one another.
  257) And women have the same rights as men have in equitableness (recognition/approval/fairness), therefore men
have no preeminence over women.
  258) If a separation between man and woman has been pronounced and a letter of separation given, then they
may join together again and contract a new bond of marriage; this shall not happen more than twice, because
it is not permitted three times since this proves that the relationship of marriage and the human bond between
the two cannot be maintained and gives rise to discord, therefore the man and woman discharge one another
from the bonds of marriage in a decorous wise and in kindheartedness, and give one another the letter of
separation so that the bond may not be concluded between the pair on another occasion.
  259) And if a separation has been pronounced between a man and woman then it is not permitted for the man to
demand back from the woman or for the woman to demand back from the man anything that had been given
to her or him during the course of the bond of marriage, unless the woman herself or the man himself wishes
to give something back that was given to her or him; therefore it is given that these imposed barriers shall be
observed, although the purpose is not in order to gain freedom, because nothing shall be given to get it; there-
fore these barriers shall not be overstepped so that you will not be without equitableness (unfair ones/irrespon-
sible ones/inequitable ones) and do not fall into the responsibility of the other.
  260) Just as children are no property of the parents, so no person of your kind (human being) is the property of
another, therefore servitude (bondage) and slavery amongst people of your kind (human beings) contravene
the honour and dignity of people of your kind (human beings) and infringe the laws and recommendations of
the primal power (Creation) and go against love, freedom, peace and concord (harmony) which have incon-
trovertible value as the basic principle of the existence and contain both equitableness (fairness) and dignity
for people of your kind (humanity).
  261) A bond of marriage shall apply in every case when a woman and a man come together for forming a line (fam-
ily) and it makes no difference whether the bond is concluded between the man and woman by their own voli-
tion (endeavour and decision) or by an assessment and conclusion through the authority (marriage performed
by them); and in the bond of marriage, the woman and man shall be joined together in all things with the
same duties and rights.
  262) And it is not permitted that parents promise their children to other children in a bond of marriage at an ear-
lier or later date; and it is not permitted for parents to force their children through Gewalt and compulsion into
concluding a bond of marriage, because woman and man are free to determine (make decisions) and are free
in their opinion and inclination as to entering a bond of marriage; and it is also not permitted for siblings to
force their siblings into a bond of marriage through Gewalt and compulsion if this is not in accordance with
the free volition of the pressed sibling; and it is not permitted for relations or non-relations to force a woman
or a man into a marital bond in any wise; therefore it is also not permitted for children to enter into a marital
bond with one another before the time when they have grown out of childhood and have therefore reached
their full swelling (growth/adulthood) and it is not permitted for a woman or a man to be purchased in order
to enter a bond of marriage.
  263) And neither a man nor a woman shall be married, no matter how much they may like one another, if they curse the truth of the laws of the primal power (Creation), the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
  the teaching of the life, because they are not merely unknowing ones in the truth but are ones without equit -
  ableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) who are wallowing in falsehood, practising evil and
  conducting their life in Ausartung; even an unknowing woman in the truth or an unknowing man in the truth
  is better than those who curse the truth; if you marry someone who curses the truth then you will have no joy
  with them, find no well-being and no love as well as no comfort and no peace and neither freedom nor con-
  sonance (harmony), but only maliciousness and strife as well as discord and affliction; those who curse the real truth, call to the fire of Ausartung and destruction, therefore through them there can be no ongoing existence of a bond of marriage; therefore know what a woman and a man are reflecting and striving for so that a wise decision may be taken about them.
  264) And if you marry believers who attach themselves to gods or tin gods then protect yourselves from their belief
so that you do not fall into the same water in which the belief in their gods or tin gods is swimming.
  265) And if a woman is having a monthly cleansing (menstruation) then the man shall not go to the woman, but
stay away from her womb throughout the days of cleansing and for two days thereafter until she is once again
clean; when the woman is once again cleansed then the man may go to her again as is given to you as a duty
and a source of enjoyment; and all those who keep to the recommendation live in rationality and in equitable-
ness (fairness) because they are the ones who keep themselves clean.
  266) The woman is not the man's property of sensuality (sexuality) which he may approach when and how he will,
because the woman's volition and need are preconditions in order to complete the sexual intercourse, there-
fore a willing mutuality shall be given so that the woman and man share the same volition, so that no com-
pulsion is exerted; and if woman and man sleep together willingly then it shall be given that love and good-
ness are granted in advance so that both may meet one another in dignity and love and fulfil their act of love
in the same wise.
  267) And a bond of purely same-gender concordance (partnership) is permitted, thus between woman and woman
and between man and man so that they live together in communality with equal rights in all things; however,
the bond between man and man shall be such that they do not change their appearance (nature) in order to
be able to bear children, so that they do not violate the laws and the regulation of the primal power (Creation);
and in same-gender concordance between partners it is permitted for sensuality (sexual doings) to take place
as with heterosexual concordance.
  268) And it is permitted to the woman as well as to the man to bestow pleasure (satisfaction, i.e. self-gratification)
on her or his own sexual organ, because it is in the appearance (nature) of the two and it does not infringe
the laws of the primal power (Creation) to do such.
  269) And the sexual misuse of children is a serious outrage and a shameful act against the children and the laws of
the primal power (Creation), therefore such an act is to be condemned with hard punishment of the execution
of fulfilment of guidelines, a separation of men or separation of women (banishment and exclusion from the
people/society, separated by gender) and with dishonour for the necessary time.
  270) And if you beget offspring then first consider whether you have the capability and possibility to bring up and
feed children truly rightfully; and so it shall be that no illnesses are present for the offspring which they could
inherit; therefore it shall not be permitted for deracinated (asocial ones) and enemies of people (enemies of
society) to have offspring, nor shall it be permitted to those who use Gewalt and those who threatened the
life and safety of the people (terrorists, etc.); also those who are incapable of bringing up and nourishing chil-
dren as well as those who are confused and sick in their inner world (consciousness) and in their psyche as well
as those with inherited illnesses and those addicted to fermented juices and medicines and intoxicants (drugs
or narcotics) shall not be allowed to beget offspring; offspring shall only be permitted in the number of three
per woman and in one marital bond; therefore the number of three offspring per woman also applies if a
former bond has been dissolved and the letter of separation given, and if then a new bond is entered into; if
a woman already has one child from a previous marital bond then the number of two offspring shall not be
exceeded in a further bond, so that the number of three children applies per woman.
  271) And the recommendation is given that mothers must nourish their children (infants) at their breast for two
years so that the children receive all the necessary nourishment for their health and survival throughout their
entire life, because the mother's nourishment is of great importance; and the begetter of the child shall be
obliged to provide for the child's mother and the child's nourishment and clothing in accordance with the cus-
toms and habits of the people in question; however, the father of the child shall not be imposed upon beyond
his ability so that he can carry out his duty in honour and dignity; therefore the child's mother shall not allow
the father to suffer, nor her child, nor shall the child's father allow the mother and the child to suffer; and the
same thing applies to the godparents and the siblings and relatives or other wardens and the heirs.
  272) If the mother and father decide for whatever reasons in joint agreement regarding the health of the child or
of the mother and following good advice that the child shall be weaned off the mother's breast, then that is
their concern and no reproach shall be offered; and if the mother is unable to nourish her child at her own
breast then a wet nurse may be taken for breast feeding the child, but the wet nurse must receive an agreed
upon payment in accordance with equitableness (fairness).
  273) And if the man or the woman dies during the bond of marriage, then the sadness and sorrow shall be dealt with in dignity and the deceased man or woman remembered in honour; the sorrowing shall not be unconsid-
  ered and not in such a wise as to bring forth any illness in the inner world (consciousness) or the psyche; there -
  fore the mourning shall also not last too long, but be guided by objectivity and comprehension; and honour
  and dignity shall be borne so that the surviving partner does not practise any self-gratification or sexuality for a period of time to be determined by herself or himself, in order to guard herself or himself against regret and shame; however once the period of self-imposed abstinence has expired, then the surviving woman or the sur- viving man may do whatever she or he likes with herself or himself in accordance with equitableness (their own approval/fairness) without burdening herself or himself with pangs of conscience for anything.
  274) And it shall be a matter of decency and honour and respect that the surviving man or the surviving woman
waits twenty four months before contracting another bond of marriage; however, it is not beneath dignity and
honour and respect to think about another woman or another man during the twenty four months and to
maintain a friendship with him or her with the intention of entering into a bond of marriage; however, during
the waiting time of decency and honour and respect do not secretly conclude an agreement for a bond of mar-
riage, because this is not seemly; if you do this, however, then you are putting yourselves in ignominy and dis-
repute; therefore do not decide on a bond of marriage before expiry of the bidden time, so that you will stand
in honour and dignity before the people of your kind (human beings); therefore you shall think about guard-
ing yourselves against contravening the recommendation, then know whatever you do and omit, the ones
without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) and the unknowing ones in the truth
are not forgiving and not forbearing.
  275) It will not be counted against you if you separate, the man from his woman and the woman from her man, if
you do not consummate rightfully (not sexually unified) and do not touch one another; but if you do not sepa-
rate because of this and therefore stay together then you shall remain in honour and dignity of one another
and take care for one another in all things; and you shall take care in accordance with the extent of your
wealth, the rich according to their kind and the poor according to their kind; this makes the support as it
should be, and this is the duty of the righteous ones (conscientious ones).
  276) And if you separate before you have touched one another, but after you have jointly created something and
have amassed wealth together, then both the woman and the man shall have half of what has been accumu-
lated and therefore the goods and chattels and the ownership and the wealth; but that which the woman or
the man brought into the bond of marriage as a dowry shall remain their personal and undisputed property;
unless the woman or the man voluntarily surrenders her or his own dowry in whole or in part in favour of the
other party; always remain close to righteousness (conscientiousness) in your decrees (instructions) and regu-
lations, and do not forget to do one another true good even if you have separated from one another.
  277) And those of you who die and leave a woman or a man behind shall take care during your life so that the sur-
viving partner, the woman or the man, will be provided for (money/wealth, in new times also a pension) for a
long time so that the requirement for life and housing will be secured; they shall however not be rebuked if
they want to bear the responsibility for providing for themselves and therefore make arrangements for them-
selves if they do this in accordance with equitableness (their own discretion in fairness) and power.
  278) And those who have separated from the bond of marriage shall not be provided with any support because
each one goes their own way, woman and man, therefore they are responsible for their own upkeep in the
entire extent (scope) and neither the man shall pay for the upkeep of the woman, nor the woman for the
upkeep of the man; if children have come forth from the bond of marriage then the separated persons are
equally obligated to pay for the upkeep of the children, therefore the mother by half and the father by half,
because in no case shall only the mother or the father be responsible for the living costs and upkeep of the
children, by means of which one parent would obtain benefits and advantages from the other; and if the
mother or the father refuses to pay her or his half of the support for the children then the legal process shall
demand an accounting and half of the support for the children from the fallible mother or the fallible father;
and if the fallible mother or the fallible father refuses nevertheless to uphold her or his duty then the punish-
ment shall be the fulfilment of guidelines in isolation from the people (society) until the children have grown
up (to adulthood); and the fallible one who acted in this wise shall be paid for the work they will have to pro-
vide to the extent that half of the support for the children is assumed and their pay shall be given to the parent
who is in charge of the children's upbringing and upkeep; and the children shall spend a certain number of
days with the mother and a certain number of days with the father for their upbringing and upkeep because
the children shall not be split between the parents in such a wise that any rejection (growing apart) results;
therefore man and woman shall go their own ways in the separation (divorce) of their bond of marriage and
be responsible for their own upkeep to the full extent (scope) and, accordingly, half the upkeep of the chil-
dren, so that neither party, woman or man, suffers disadvantages from the man paying to support the woman
or the woman paying to support the man; because even when the bond of marriage has been separated, man
and woman have the same duties and rights, both as man and woman and as mother and father.
279) Truly, the prophets gave you and give you recommendations as they are given for the equality of all people of
 your kind (human beings) and for the equivalence and the rights of the woman and the man and the children,
 so that you may understand it.
280) Truly, you have received life through the laws of origination (Creation) and through its works, but you disre-
 gard the laws and recommendations of origination (Creation) as you also disregard the teaching of the pro-
 claimers, the prophets, and revile them and do not give them any thanks although they are fighting for the
 truth and for your well-being, because they are knowing and wise and bring you their love; but you do not
 want to be knowing and you threaten them with death despite the fact that they teach you, so you shall lead
 a better and an equitable (fair/responsible) life.
281) Truly, there is scarcely a single one amongst you who would give a prophet a goodly gesture of appreciation
 (give consent) so that he could increase knowledge with further knowledge; truly, you belittle the prophet's
 knowledge of the truth and increase your unknowledge so you do not find the truth; but search for the real
 truth and fight for it in a peaceful wise once you have found it.
282) Fight in a peaceful and Gewalt-less wise for the truth of formation (Creation) and its laws and recommenda-
 tions against those who fight you and the real truth, but in doing this do not exceed the bounds of goodness
 and equitableness (fairness/responsibility) so that you do not fall into acts of Gewalt, because lack of restraint
 and Gewalt are not liked by the people of your kind (human beings).
283) Be at all times peaceful to those who believe themselves to be your enemies, who fight you and drive you from one place to another; and love those who call themselves your enemies for the sake of their dignification
(being human in the real and true sense) as people of your kind, and do not hate them because of their bad
deeds, but only assess their bad deeds and do not make assessments about the people of your kind (human
beings) as people of your kind (human beings); and wherever you meet any who give themselves as your ene-
mies, then do not deem them to be enemies on your own account either; do not kill (murder) them or drive them
away, but offer them the hand of peace and create friendship between you and them; therefore do not pursue
those who believe themselves to be your enemies either in order to mete out evil revenge and retaliation on
them, because persecution and revenge and retaliation are as bad as manslaughter; if your self-appointed enemies
attack you, then fight against them with gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit, with words and deeds, but you shall not
kill in Ausartung but only if there is an inescapable danger to your life, so that you only kill in defence in extremis
(self-defence) when your life is threatened; when however the ones who believe they are your enemies let go
of you then show them benevolence (humanity) and forgiveness so that there will be peace between you.
284) Only fight against your self-appointed enemies with the means of knowledge and peace until their persecu-
 tion of you ceases and they allow rationality in themselves; and when they cease their persecution of you and
 turn to you in peace then know that you shall not show any hostility to them, just as you shall not harbour
 any hostility towards the unknowing ones and those who are without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible
 ones/inequitable ones).
285) If the ones who call themselves your enemies or those without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/
 inequitable ones) or unknowing ones defile your honour and dignity and your righteousness (conscientious-
 ness) through lying and deception and slander (calumny), then their actions shall not be retributed by you with
 lovelessness and hatred or with revenge and other evil; in all laws of the formation (Creation) and the appear-
 ance (nature), there are no laws of retaliation and revenge, neither of hatred nor other evil.
286) If those who call themselves your enemies as well as unknowing ones or those without equitableness (unfair
 ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) commit brutality then do not punish them with hostility or hatred
 and revenge or retaliation and other evil, but practise equitableness (be fair/fairness) and strive for forgiveness,
 and know that equitableness (fairness) is with those who nourish it; if a fallible human being commits brutal-
 ity against you in any wise, and you cannot defend yourselves against it through rationality and equitableness
 (being fair), then do not administer punishment yourselves through self-justice, rather call on the authority or
 jurisdiction so that the matter and the things will be clarified by them and the fallible ones judged in accor-
 dance with equitableness (fairness) and the dignification of people of your kind (humanity), as is appropriate
 for the offence committed against you.
287) Give donations as often as you can and are able for the sake of the truth, the teaching of the truth, the teach -
 ing of the spirit, the teaching of the life, so that the teaching of the truth concerning the primal wellspring
 (Creation) and its laws and recommendations spread themselves; but in spreading the teaching, do not cast
 yourselves into ruin by your own hand, therefore do not donate more than your power and your wealth per-
 mit; do good at all times and do not undertake commerce with the truth-teaching, just as you shall also not
 proclaim it at the top of your voice and not attack and make enemies of unknowing ones and believers in gods
 and tin gods with the teaching, and as you also shall not try to proselytise them.
288) And, for the sake of the truth, always carry out everything in honesty and equitableness (fairness) and instruct
 (teach) your next ones without encouraging and without coercing them in the words of the truth and in the
 laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) so that they may also learn and be in agree-
 ment with them in order to live in equitableness (to be fair/to live in fairness) and to lead a good life.
 289) And it is taught to you that you shall not shear your head because of a belief in a god or tin gods or for the
  sake of a false teacher who demands such from you in false truth; and you shall not circumcise your sexual
  organ because of a belief in a god or tin gods or for the sake of a false teacher, unless it is necessary because
  of health; but it is said to you through the true proclaimers, the true prophets, that you shall clean your sexual
  organ every day as a matter of course because health and cleanliness demand it; and therefore clean your sex-
  ual organ after every connection (sexual intercourse); and cover your head from the sun, because its fiery beam
  (ray) is full of danger and brings forth injury, and this recommendation applies both to woman and man; and
  therefore it applies to man and woman that you must cover your face with a cloth when the fiery glow (radia-
  tion) is very strong or if impurities and dust are filling the air, otherwise you may suffer from it.
 290) Do not quarrel with people of your kind (fellow human beings) or with those without equitableness (unfair
  ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) and not with unknowing ones and therefore not with believers re-
  garding the real truth, because it is given by the laws and recommendations of the primal power (Creation),
  and they are immutable; only the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) is the true might over you and the unmea-
  surable secret and you shall not have either other mights or gods and tin gods or venerable ones (holy ones)
  beside it; truly, only the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) is the highest over you, and it alone has performed
  the great works on earths (worlds/planets) and in the firmaments (universe), and only from it have all earths
  (worlds/planets) and firmaments (universe) and all life originated, in the same wise you also shall carry out your
  works according to your ability so that great as greatness and good as goodness may come forth from them;
  and when doing this be at all times upright in your efforts, because you shall not be malefactors (lawbreakers),
  and remember that you shall not misuse the name of the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) and that you shall
  keep it honoured.
 291) And as you do your works, so you shall make every day a day of festivity so that you accomplish your deeds
  in honour and that you do not fall victim to lowly temptations; every day, you shall do your work in honour so
  that you find joy in your doing and that you remain in equitableness (fairness), so that you do not do the same
  as those without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) who procure what they need
  by theft and lying and deception; therefore may you consider that ill-gotten goods never prosper.
 292) Follow equitableness (fairness/responsibility) at all times and do not break the bond with the wellspring of wis-
  dom (Creation) which you shall honour as you honour and love your parents; and therefore you shall also not
  break the bond of marriage once you have entered into it, because a consummated bond is venerable, a proof
  (controlling) which you shall always be conscious of.
 293) And it has been taught you since time immemorial that you shall not commit false witness (perjury), neither
  against a woman or a man, nor against your next one and the truth and also not against life and the well-
  spring of wisdom (Creation); and as you shall not give false witness (perjury), so you shall never speak the
  untruth, because truly, the untruth is always inconstant and pushes to the light of the world, so that every liar
  fails; the untruth also lies in cursing the truth, therefore the truth shall not be cursed against because doing so
  yields no good fruits and no good reward.
 294) And do not dare to misuse the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) for worth-
  less cults, for divinities and tin gods which are only inventions by people of your kind (human beings); and do
  not drop down (on your knees) before those who have raised themselves up to be gods and exalted ones and
  false teachers and prophets; and do not use the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of wisdom
  (Creation) for hateful speeches, and do not exaggerate them and make sure that no strife comes from this; do
  good from the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of wisdom (Creation) and equip yourselves with
  patience in righteousness (conscientiousness), so that you will always live as ones of intellect.
 295) You will not come to any harm if you make use of the fullness of the goodness of the wellspring of wisdom
  (Creation), because its ample grace is given to you amply for all time so that you may think and act through
  your own power and of your own will in all things both in the false and in the right and so you may bring your-
  selves onto the way of the truth; if, however, you hurry away from the benefit of the wellspring of wisdom
  (Creation), then consider that you belong to the ones who have gone astray.
 296) And if you carry out acts obligated by the primal wellspring (Creation), which are given to you through the
  laws and recommendations, then you are creating your own glory in yourselves, just as all those living in equi -
  tableness (fairness/responsibility) before you created and upheld the same glory and were able to celebrate in
  love and peace as well as in freedom and consonance (harmony).
 297) Some of those amongst you demand special signs (evidence) for themselves of the truth and the primal well-
  spring (Creation) so that they may believe, but the truth is not belief, nor does the primal wellspring (Creation)
  send special signs (evidence) for the individual who demands them, because truly all existence of all earths
  (worlds/planets) and firmaments (universe), all animals and other creatures and all people of your kind (human
  beings), as well as the existence of all life and all stars in the firmaments (universe) are unmeasurable signs
  (marvels) of the presence of the primal wellspring (Creation) and whoever may comprehend it, comprehends
  it.
  298) Never be haughty with your next ones, and live in modesty with everyone and with yourselves; do not strive
for renown and fame, because otherwise you will fall victim to megalomania, selfishness and wanting to appear
to be more than you are, as well as the worship in irrationality performed by others who bow down to pay
you homage (glorify you).
  299) And whoever amongst you is ill or has a suffering in the head (consciousness/psyche) shall expunge this by obtaining the help of those who are versed in medicine if he or she cannot help himself or herself; but if you
  are not ill and without suffering then be thankful and benevolent and give alms (gifts) to those who are ill and
  full of suffering and who are unable to put themselves in the care of those versed in medicine for healing.
  300) If there is a place somewhere where the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the
life is taught in a truly truthly wise, then make a journey there and learn the truth-teaching so that you may
be knowing ones and equitable ones (fair ones/responsible ones), and no blame will be put on you for doing
this; and if you want to make the journey, then you shall think about not conducting any hateful talk, nor per-
mitting yourselves any breach of the laws and recommendations of the Creation and no strife either.
  301) The good that you do on the journey is seen by those who are with you, therefore provide yourselves with the
necessary victuals so that you can also nourish those who are in need and do not have any victuals for the jour-
ney to the place of the truth-teaching; but truly, consider that the best victual at all times is righteousness
(conscientiousness).
  302) And when you return from the place of the truth-teaching to your dwelling, then think about the teaching of
the truth, the proclaimers, the prophets, so that you will keep it in yourselves and be well led by it; and this
applies even if you were previously one of those who had gone astray, before you imbibed the truth-teaching
in yourselves.
  303) Always think about the truth-teaching of the prophets for all time, but you do not bring down any guilt on
yourselves if you nevertheless do unright on one or another occasion because this is the way of the learning;
therefore it is given that you are also fallible in the knowledge of the truth, in order to learn from it, but in this
sense only be doers of unright in what concerns your thinking and feeling and in your nature as well as in
understanding and actions; do not however be as doers of unright also fallible ones, because the sense of the
fallible ones is to do evil and illegal things deliberately in order to advantage themselves and to obtain unlaw-
ful gain from it
  304) Believers in a god or tin gods say that their god or tin god may bestow good on them in this world and good
in the future world, and they beg in blind submissiveness that their god or tin god may save them from the
anguish of the fire of the shadow world (hell) and its princes; however neither a god nor a tin god is truthly
given, because they are only imaginary forms which are fabulated (invented) by yourselves without responsibil-
ity and which have no might even to make a single hair on your head turn grey; and therefore the shadow
world (hell) and its fire and the prince of the shadow world (prince of hell) are only inventions by irresponsible
and honourless ones amongst you who have fallen victim to a delusion of belief, as well as their own might
which they wish to wield over you in order to obtain great gain of all kinds from it; and therefore the shadow
world (hell) is no place, because truly it is a state in your head (consciousness) and a mentality (thoughts, feel-
ings and psyche).
  305) If you obey your god or tin gods in your belief, then you will receive your share according to your belief and
its merit, then consider that it is not a god or a tin god which effectuates the things that you believe, but only
the might of your thoughts and your inner world (consciousness).
  306) When you think about the truth of formation (Creation) and its laws and recommendations and are loyally con-
nected to them, then you do not bring down any guilt upon yourselves, when you follow the laws and recom-
mendations and oppose evil, falsehood and inequity (unfairness) in order to pay tribute to the truth; and do
not be afraid of evil and falsehood or of inequity (unfairness), but trust in your knowledge of the truth so that
you make use of it and gather like-minded ones about you.
  307) Many have gathered amongst you whose words about this life appeal to many of you, and who like to be led into confusion through their beliefs and words when the delusional leaders speak in the name of a false truth
  and of a delusional belief and misuse them for lies and deception, and for their evil doings they even take the
  formation (Creation) to be witness and call on it; however they are living and effecting in lies and deception,
  and what is in them is only cantankerous squabbling and malicious delusional leading of those who listen to
  them; and when they have the might then they go about the country fomenting unpeace, hatred and battles
  (war) against all those who are of another belief and another skin colour as well as of another race and other
  peoples; and they are caught up in their self-opinionated attitude (fanaticism) and fervour and in their false
  and stubborn conviction; and against all right and all responsibility, they spread threats and Gewalt, and they
  also lay waste to the seed and the fruits of the field, just as they also commit bloody deeds (murder) and atro-
  cities and destroy your works and homes; but truly, the laws and recommendations of the formation (Creation)
  do not teach such doings, but love and peace as well as freedom and harmony and equitableness (fairness);
  and if they are told they should be afraid when you recognise their evil doings and be afraid that they may be
  called to account, then their pride and their irrationality drives them to further guilt which they will have to carry and will demand a reckoning from them sooner or later, whether through themselves or by authority or jurisdiction; and they are unknowing ones and ones without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/in- equitable ones) in whose thoughts and feelings and in whose psyche the shadow world (hell) blazes as reward, and truly this inner condition is a bad state and of destructive constitution.
  308) And truly, many of those amongst you would sell themselves or their mothers in the striving of belief for their
god or tin gods, but each one among you is waiting in vain for your god or tin gods and their favour and good-
ness for you, because gods and tin gods are powerless inventions of your own which you want to use to turn
everyone else into your servants (hands/helpers).
  309) And all of you who are living in belief in your god or tin gods, not only are you approaching them entirely in
total devotion but are also following the footsteps of the delusional leaders who truly are your manifest ene-
mies and are only using you to obtain their own gains.
  310) You will always partake of your false belief and its merit that is directed (regulated) according to what you are
hoping and wishing for yourselves because all of fulfilment lies in your inner world (consciousness), through
the might of which you direct and call forth everything and make yourselves into what you are.
  311) The prophets have given you signs (evidence) of the real truth and of the true existence of the Creation and
of its laws and recommendations, but you turn away from the clear signs (evidence), that have come to you
through the prophets and have been given by the Creation since the existence of the earths (worlds/planets)
and the firmaments (universe) and are ever-present; you shall however not turn away, but be knowing in the
truth and in the laws and recommendations of the Creation, so that you may be full of equitableness (fairness/
responsibility).
  312) And heed the truth-teaching which teaches you to uphold all virtues and be honourable in their fulfilment,
because according to them you will be assessed as people of your kind (human beings) by people of your kind
(human beings); however, anyone who lives without virtue is debasing themselves and making themselves into
an outcast and ausgerartet one.
  313) Do not wait for your gods and tin gods to come to you in the shadow of clouds and with liberators (angels)
in order to judge you and decide in equitableness (fairness) whether you will go into the fire of the shadow
world (hell) or into heaven in their paradise (realm of gods and tin gods); truly, this will not happen, because
you will not return to your gods or your tin gods because they are inventions of your own without any power
and without any existence and reality, but are only imagined, unsubstantial delusions.
  314) As a person of your kind (human being), your dwelling is the world on which you live, and as such you can
only raise yourselves into the firmament (space/universe) with flying craft that you build for yourselves, in order
for you to be able to cross the air of Earth and the firmaments (space/universe); but even with such flying craft
you cannot reach the heaven of one of your invented gods or tin gods (realm of gods and tin gods), because
the heaven and its gods and tin gods (realm of gods and tin gods) are really only inventions of your imagina-
tions.
  315) In you, there lives the spirit which is a minute part of the formation (Creation), therefore you are also a part of
the formation (Creation); however, your body is of your world and when you die then it will cease to be and
will not return, just as it will not cross over into a heaven of your gods and tin gods and not into a paradise
(realm of gods and tin gods), but will cease to be; only your form of the spirit in you is subject to reincarna-
tion and intended to one day return to the formation (Creation) in order to become one with it, although you
as a person cease to exist and will no longer continue to be such.
  316) Many clear signs (evidence) of the truth and the existence of the formation (Creation) and its laws and recom-
mendations have been given to you since time immemorial by the true proclaimers of the truth, but after you
had received the teaching of the truth, you swapped this gift for the untruth of your belief in your gods and
tin gods, therefore you have punished yourselves and continue to do so up to the present day; and it will take
a very long time until you perceive the truth and understand it, so you will suffer in untruth as unknowing ones
for a very long time and will commit many evil things and bring down guilt on yourselves.
  317) Your life on the world is made so that you learn and fulfil the sense of the life that is given in the swelling (evo-
lution) of knowledge and wisdom, in fulfilment of love and peace as well as freedom and consonance (harmo-
ny) which become truth and reality for you and shall apply to all amongst you.
  318) The beauty of all things and signs (unsurpassabilities) of the wellspring of existence (Creation) and its appear - ance (nature) shall appear appealingly to you and reveal the truth and grace of the wellspring of existence
  (Creation) and its laws and recommendations to you, but there are very many amongst you who scorn the real
  truth and those who have knowledge of the truth, but both the wellspring of existence (Creation) itself as well
  as the prophets and those who have knowledge of the truth stand at your side with their love and freedom
  as well as with their peace and their harmony and are gracious to you, because in your unknowledge you do
not know what shameful things you are doing against the wellspring of existence (Creation), the truth, those
who have knowledge and against the proclaimers of the truth; your unknowledge and your shameful doing
will be forgiven because you have been led into confusion and have to learn.
  319) And there are many amongst you who boast in your megalomania and selfishness and place yourselves in the
light of attention of the people of your kind (human beings) in order to shine before them, but your nature is
depraved and your psyche and inner world (consciousness) are ill through wanting to shine before the others;
and truly, your efforts are based on immodesty and in the greediness to make a sensation about your person,
but your present existence is therefore joyless and inequitable (unfair), and your happiness is as fragile as mouldy
wood, and your life-conduct is as useless as a rotting fruit.
  320) Modesty is the true nature of the true people of your kind (human beings), who go along in honesty and equi-
tableness (fairness/responsibility) and who determine their words and deeds accordingly; and it is not possible
to trust anyone who raises themselves up and sets themselves above others in any wise, rather true trust can
only be given to someone who leads their present existence in modesty and also displays modesty in their
dealings with you.
  321) Those who fear immodesty and move in true modesty, and therefore lead their present existence in the same
wise, they will always stand above those who are immodest, because the modest ones gain true friends
through honour and dignity, and the immodest ones and those addicted to sensation and worship find their
actions are only sufficient to establish false friendship and idolatry by those who are bowing down (are in
bondage) to them, who are blind-believingly and sufferingly caught up in false zeal through their delusion of
their thoughts and feelings.
  322) The peoples of your kind (humankind) were peaceful communities in the earliest times, but over time they
grew apart and became at odds with one another and fractious and enemies, because they grew apart from
the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) and the laws of appearance (nature); but
there were wise ones amongst the people who lived their existence in a good wise according to the laws and
recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) and according to the laws of appearance (nature), there -
fore they established themselves as teachers in order to instruct the peoples who had become disloyal and fal-
lible to the direst extent in the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) and in the laws
of appearance (nature), to teach them all right things and how to follow the truth and the laws and recom-
mendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) and the laws of appearance (nature); and amongst all the wise
ones, a particularly wise one came forth, Nokodemion, who prevailed as the bringer of the message of the
laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation) and the laws of appearance (nature) and as
their teacher and warner, and gave rise to the line of the series of prophets; and therefore all successors of his
person remained at this task from birth to birth, making this their determination, because the wise teacher
changed himself into the proclaimer, the prophet, and endured for eons in continuous coming again in a new
person in order to appear in the far future on your earth as Henoch (Enoch), as the first prophet on the earth-
roundness in the far line of Nokodemion; and it will be that the line of Nokodemion will be continued in the
same form of spirit, but however always in a new person with a new inner world (consciousness), in a sequence
of seven from Henoch (Enoch) to the new time when the last prophet in the series will complete the work of
the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
  323) The word and the writing of the truth-teaching has been given by the proclaimers, the prophets, as a teaching in a equal wise, so it is not doubtful or contradictory, but is however passed on from proclaimer, prophet, to
  proclaimer, prophet, in an ever more advanced form of explanation, given in accordance with your new and
  better understanding; and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life has been
  given to you by Nokodemion and by all proclaimers, prophets, in his line as a guideline (sign-posting/leading
  thought) of the life and the swelling (evolution) of your inner world (consciousness), so that you may decide
  between right and unright, as you fulfil the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring (Creation).
  324) In early times, you were at odds about leading the present existence, and you killed (murdered) and slew one another, and so you were given the truth-teaching by the proclaimers, the prophets; and you were given clear
  signs (evidence) by the proclaimers, because you were disunited amongst one another, but the signs (evidence)
  were disregarded and misconstrued and assigned to the evil and this was done out of envy for one another
  because you begrudge the one or another amongst you to be able to explain the signs (evidence) correctly.
  325) The proclaimers of the truth set you on the right way, and each of you who turned to the teaching of the truth
was rightly led and rose in the value of your knowledge above those who were disunited; and those who were
connected to the teaching of the truth have been striving continuously since time immemorial to show (reveal)
to the unknowing ones in the truth the right path so that they may become knowing and equitable ones (fair
ones/responsible ones).
  326) Do not think that you will go into heaven (dwelling of the gods and tin gods) to a god or tin gods, because just like the gods and tin gods, your heaven (realm of gods and tin gods) is only an invention by you who are
  without any responsibility, but are caught in a delusion, or are striving for great gain and to beat you into servi -
  tude (bondage) and slavery and unautonomy in order to plunder you and to be able to take from you what is your property and what you have earned and created through the sweat of your brow; therefore they use their delusional teachings to beat you into a belief in fabulated (invented) divinities and tin gods and in a fabulated (invented) heaven as paradise (realm of gods and tin gods) so that you will be caught and bound in your thoughts and in your feelings and in your inner world (consciousness) in order for them to attain advantages from you for their own benefit and so they can use your goods and your possessions and the content of your strongbox (savings) to lead a life in pleasure and splendour.
  327) Learn what those who passed away before you learned, those who turned to the teaching of the truth and
who had a good existence thereby, because they did not fall into poverty and hardship through unknowledge
of the truth and were not shaken by Gewalt because they were connected to the teaching of the prophets and
therefore the truth-teaching, because they were helped by following the real truth.
  328) And if you are asked whether you should give donations to the poor and needy, to the sick and suffering and
for the truth-teaching, in order to spread it, then answer that whatever goodly and ample wealth is given to
this cause brings its own gladness and prosperousness, just as it prospers the spreading of the truth and love,
as well as help for the sick and suffering, for the poor and needy and for orphans and wayfarers.
  329) And whatever you do that is good, truly it will be rewarded to you by people of your kind (human beings) and
through all your life, because nothing goes unrewarded in its form.
  330) You have not been commanded by the laws and recommendations of the Creation to fight by shedding blood
and destroying, which may displease you in your doings of hatred and revenge and retaliation, but you have
been given the truth of the laws and recommendations so that it is very well possible for you in your free will
to deem a thing or a law and recommendation as unwelcome although it is good for you.
  331) And truly, the freedom is given to you to deem things good and welcome despite them being harmful, there- fore use your intellect and decide accordingly so that you go the right way and do not fight senseless fights.
  332) And if you are asked whether you should fight and kill with weapons for your belief, then say that fighting
and Gewalt with weapons and killing for a belief are not rightful and not in accordance with the laws and
recommendations of the Creation, and therefore do not comply with the truth of the life.
  333) You shall never accept other things, such as lies and slanders (calumnies) and other untruth, as true, just like
you should not accept any belief in a god or tin gods, because all of them are lying inventions and therefore
untruth.
  334) Do not commit a serious misdemeanour against the truth by not accepting it and banishing it, and by perse-
cuting those who are knowing of the truth, because banishment and persecution are equally as bad as man-
slaughter
  335) Heed the words of the truth that truth-deniers are those who are without equitableness (unfair ones/irrespon-
sible ones/inequitable ones) and who are without knowledge of the truth and those who cloak themselves in
priestly robes in accordance with their belief in a god or tin gods and continue to fight against and revile the
ones amongst the people who are versed in the truth as well as the true prophets; and if it is not possible for
them to prevail over the equitable ones (fair ones) then they take recourse to slander (calumny) or they
slaughter them or have them killed (murdered) in a dastardly fashion.
  336) And those who are without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones/inequitable ones) and the believers,
as well as the priests of gods and tin gods, will not cease earlier their evil deeds of fighting against those who
are knowing of the truth, insulting them, slandering them or slaying them or having them killed (murdered) in
dastardly fashion; and they will not take an early repose until they have made the ones who have knowledge
of the truth defect to their belief and to their god or tin gods, even if they were able to do so, because it is
not possible to get those who are knowing of the truth away from their true knowledge about the truth.
  337) Believers in a god or tin gods are not the same as those who are knowing of the truth, because they allow
themselves to be persuaded to leave one belief for another belief, and they are the ones who go through their
present existence as losers and miss the true life; they have no trust in life and do not live it because they be -
lieve in their gods and tin gods and that heaven and paradise (realm of gods and tin gods) are awaiting them
or that, after their existence on Earth, they will have to eke out their ongoing life as inhabitants of the fire in
damnation, depending on how they conduct their present existence on Earth.
  338) Those who are knowing about the truth of the wellspring of existence (Creation) and its laws and recommen -
dations and those who are struggling for the cause of this truth, they are the ones who are anticipating and
will win everything good in the present existence; therefore they are also kindhearted and lenient towards you,
even when they are reviled and slandered by you, because they are benevolent and forgiving, as is demanded
by the truth-teaching of the prophets.
  339) If you are asked about wine and fermented juices, then say that there is great harm in both if they are enjoyed to excess and drunkenness ensues; therefore they bring great harm to those who fall into a pathological
  craving for them, because the pathological craving strikes the inner world (consciousness) and the psyche with injurious disease and delusion and destruction just as it does the entrails (internal organs = liver, kidneys and gall bladder, etc.) and the slings (intestines) of the body.
  340) And if you are asked about the game which is supposed to lead to riches through luck, then say that there is
great harm in it, however also some benefit, which is however always a modest one; the harm, however, is
greater than the benefit if the game turns into a pathological craving through getting very badly out of the
control of the good human nature, as a result of which all goods, possessions and wealth are lost, and the
connections among friends and the family life are ruined.
  341) And if you are asked about giving then say that whatever is dispensable shall always be given, whether it be
goods and chattels or things put aside in the strongbox (savings), or whether it be good counsel or performing
a work.
  342) You are given the laws and recommendations of the Creation and the laws of appearance (nature), presented
and explained in real truth by the prophets, so that the entirety of the truth-teaching may be clear and under-
standable for you and that you may contemplate it and follow the teaching.
  343) Consider that ill-gotten goods never prosper, therefore you shall always be attentive and only think about what
is good and true, so that you only do what is good and truthly and heed and follow the laws and recommen-
dations of the Creation.
  344) And if you are asked about the world in which you live, and about the future world, then say that your world
in which you live is the world of learning, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
the life, by means of which the sense of the life shall be fulfilled, which is the unfolding and swelling (evolu-
tion) of the inner world (consciousness), so that love and knowledge and wisdom grow and peace and free-
dom and therefore consonance (harmony) are created in your nature, by means of which the spirit living in you
does the same.
  345) And if you are asked about the orphans, then say that promoting their welfare is a deed of great goodness
and a duty and that a relationship shall be entered into with the orphans and care of them shall be under-
taken.
  346) And if you are asked about fomenters of turmoil then say that they shall be distinguished from peace-bringers in such a wise that the fomenters of turmoil are called to account and the peace-bringers are rewarded.
  347) And if you are asked about the slanderers and their machinations, then say that it is worthless to do anything
against them before authority or jurisdiction, because it only brings harm and hatred and desires for revenge,
as well as the loss of goods and chattels and wealth because the authority and jurisdiction demand payment
for their administration of justice; leave the slanderers to be slanderers in themselves and outwardly, and do
not create any hatred or undertake any revenge and retaliation against them, because staying silent and amus-
ing oneself at their slanders (calumnies) is its own medicine, whereas the slanderers create harm and trouble
in themselves through their evil deeds and will soon become tired of them because they do not achieve any
success and only provide joy and benefit for the slandered ones.
  348) Do not make the truth a hindrance for yourselves through oaths, so that you do not refrain and grow apart
from doing good and rightful deeds as well as being honest and promoting peace amongst yourselves; do not
take any oath, because your word of honesty shall be enough, that this is yes, yes or no, no; therefore do not
swear any oath either on the world nor on a belief or god or tin god, because you will not be able to prove
the truliness of your word by them if it is doubted; and if it turns out that your oath was false although you
assumed it was of rightness but you had erred, then you will be unknowingly guilty of a lie or calumny (slan-
der) and will therefore commit harm to another and you will be brought to reckoning for your false avowal
(perjury); and if you speak a word of witness and avowal then act with forethought; if you are fighting on your
own behalf, then do not fight with falsehood, but in honesty, and be forbearing and forgiving against those
against whom you are fighting.
  349) Always be alert about the truth, and do not cower down in submissiveness before people of your kind (human
beings), therefore not before authority or jurisdiction either, before no enemy, and in no belief in a god or tin
gods, because you shall not be subservient; be indeed obedient when obedience is rightful, but do not be sub-
servient and do not deny yourselves; esteem and appreciate yourselves in true freedom so that you will not be
subservient to any people of your kind (human beings) or to any gods and tin gods.
  350) If you are anxious or afraid, then gird yourselves with courage by freeing yourselves from anxiety or fear
through contemplation (meditation) and putting yourselves deeply (meditatingly) into good and free thoughts
and feelings; when you are in safety however, then think about the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
spirit, the teaching of the life as the prophets have taught you and as you have received it from them.
  351) You have heard from the proclaimers, the prophets, that you shall select a wise head (wise leader) for your guidance and instruction so that you may live in love and peace as well as in freedom and balance (harmony)
  and in wisdom, and may spend your entire present existence in this wise; and you shall not take up arms and
  fight against one another or against other tribes and peoples; if you are however attacked by a battle troop (war troop/military) with armed Gewalt so that you are driven out or beaten down into servitude (bondage) or imprisoned, then fight against it with gewaltsame Gewaltlosigkeit; if the possibility of gewaltsame Gewaltlosig- keit is taken away from you, however, then conduct a battle in consequentiality (logic) by means of which solely rationality decides whether a defence in extremis (self-defence) may be justified, therefore you do not kill (mur- der) in Ausartung; however, you shall not let yourselves be stirred up (be agitated) to battles with weapons, neither in the family nor amongst groups, nor by following authority or leaders and rulers and not by follow- ing priests and other worshipers of gods and tin gods; only ever use the Gewalt of weapons to fight if you are attacked with the same, but when doing so always ensure that you are fighting rightfully and are only bringing about the death of the opponent in extremis when there is no other possibility of defending your- selves, so that you do not kill (murder) and do not become malefactors (lawbreakers) against the life of those who bring you enmity; therefore you shall defend yourselves only rightfully and not load guilt upon your life through any outrage.
  352) And it is taught to you that you shall only select wise heads (wise leaders) for your guidance who do not im-
pose mastery over you, because you are worthy not of a dominance (mastery) over you, but are worthy of a
wise and kindhearted guidance in freedom, peace, love and in concord (harmony); never elect Gewalt-rulers
over you, whether they may be people of your kind (fellow human beings) or gods or tin gods, because no
such ruler is worthy of leading you and instructing you in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
the teaching of the life; truly, you yourselves elect your wise heads (wise leaders) so that you are led rightly by
them and you can increase your knowledge and your wisdom as you are gracious towards people of your kind
(fellow human beings).
  353) The sign (evidence) of a mastery is that you are given unfreedom and you are exploited and placed under the
yoke, made dependent and enchained, whether it be by a female or male head of the family (matriarch or
patriarch), a belief in a divinity or in a tin god and by their priests, by bread-givers and wage-givers or by author-
ity, by despots and other tyrants; pay attention to these words if you are knowing and you do not want your-
selves to be beaten into servitude (bondage), because the horror-ruler and the martinet as well as the Gewalt-
ruler and other despots are many in a variety of attitudes (type, behaviour); mastery is at all times a sign (evi-
dence) for you that there is a threat of unfreedom, lovelessness, unpeace and dissonance (disharmony).
  354) Now, those who drink out of the river of the untruth are deepening themselves in (in bondage to) the lie, but
those who drink from the wellspring of the truth promise to lead their present existence in righteousness
(conscientiousness) and equitableness (fairness); and the righteous ones (conscientious ones) and the equitable
ones (fair ones/responsible ones) and all those who have knowledge of the truth have great power against all
attacks by the unknowing and inequitable ones (unfair ones/irresponsible ones), because they know with cer-
tainty that they will lead a joyful and a good life through the truth; and therefore the knowing ones in the
truth as a small group will achieve victory over all large groups of the inequitable ones (unfair ones/irresponsi-
ble ones) and the unknowing ones in the peaceful struggle for the real truth, because the prosperousness of
the truth is on the side of the stalwarts.
  355) And when the ones who have knowledge of the truth advance and meet the hordes of those without equi-
tableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones) and those without knowledge of the truth, then they pour out their
steadfastness over the ones without knowledge and the ones without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible
ones) reinforce their stance and strive to bring the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
of the life against the gaping unknowledgeness and inequity (unfairness) of the people.
  356) And those who have knowledge of the truth do not put the unknowing ones and the ones without equitable- ness (irresponsible ones/unfair ones) to flight with the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
  of the life, because if these do not want to hear the truth then the ones who have knowledge of the truth do
  the same as the prophets and continue to teach undaunted, by means of which the truth will become evident
  to the unknowing ones and those who are without equitableness (irresponsible ones/unfair ones) at a time
  (sooner or later); therefore the truth-teaching is given and taught to them so that they may recognise it as true
  at a time (sooner or later) and turn to it; and if it were the case that the prophets held themselves back in the
  explanation of their teaching, then you would also be held back in your learning; but so that it does not hap-
  pen that one holds back another, you have been given free will so you may decide for yourselves what you
  want to do or not do, if you get along peaceful with one another; and if this were not the case, then Earth
  would be filled with great chaos, and there would not be any greatness of heart amongst you and the peoples.
  357) These are the recommendations that are brought by the prophets and that proclaim the truth; and indeed, the
explanation of signs (evidence), of recommendations, are based in wisdom.
  358) Never were the prophets from the line of Nokodemion raised above other prophets, so none is raised above the other, because all proclaim the one and only teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the
  life without any difference in their value, however always re-explained in the course of time according to your
  better understanding of the teaching; therefore there have never been elevations of the prophets because the
  proclaimers of the teaching of the truth in the sense of the laws and recommendations of fruitfulness (Creation), proceeding from Nokodemion, are not placed in any order of level, because all their values and the values of the teaching are the same and immutable.
  359) All prophets are strengthened with the true love for you and all people of your kind (human beings), and by
the power of their knowledge and wisdom as well as by following the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
spirit, the teaching of the life, through which they possess the capability and talent achieved through their own
efforts without self-interest and in open modesty to teach you and all people in their teaching and in the truth
of the laws and recommendations of the origination (Creation).
  360) And if it were given by the power of the prophets and by your rationality and acceptance of the truth-teaching,
then you would never have fought with one another, never have killed (murdered) one another, not waged
any battles (wars) and not caused any destruction; at all times the prophets taught true love amongst you, as
well as freedom, peace and consonance (harmony), so that gladness and co-existence may be given; and they
gave signs (marvels) of the might of their inner world (consciousness), but they were condemned as evil illu-
sions (absurdities) and sorcery, but were not recognised as the truth which they served for; but there were some
amongst you who saw the signs (marvels) who were at odds in consideration (assessment) or who assessed
the signs (marvels) of the prophets to be an illumination of belief (proof of belief) in a god or tin gods; but it
was always in the will of the prophets to continue teaching the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit,
the teaching of the life steadfastly, and if it had been in their power, then the prophets would have ended all
evil amongst you themselves so that you would never have fought with one another; but since time immemo-
rial you have feuded with one another and committed outrages on one another involving hatred and jealousy,
in greed for wealth and might, therefore you kill (murder) and destroy for this and conduct battles (wars) and
this has continued up to the present day; but the prophets remain undismayed and carry out what they have
already started even in Nokodemion's time; but you lay hatred and slander (calumny) against them, and you
strive to take their life so that they shall be prevented from bringing the truth-teaching in order to show (re-
veal) to you and the peoples the way to real truth and love, and to freedom and consonance (harmony) and
therefore to peace amongst everyone.
  361) You, however, who are knowing in the truth-teaching of the proclaimers, the prophets, donate to those who
are searching for the truth from what the proclaimers, the prophets, have bestowed on you in the sense of the
teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life; donate from your knowledge that you
have learned from them and continue to learn so that many will become knowing in the truth of the origina-
tion (Creation) and its laws and recommendations, before a day dawns on which the truth-teaching can no
longer be passed on; donate your truthly knowledge before the day dawns on which no buying and selling
and neither intercession nor friendship are worth anything anymore, when those who persist in the untruth
and in the inequity (unfairness) inflict harm on themselves in life and in all things.
  362) Creation – there is no truth except for the laws and recommendations proceeding from Creation, from the
vitality of its BEING, from the itself-being, all-preserving; Creation is true life and it too was seized by slumber be-
fore its presence (existence), as is immanent in all life, and therefore it will fall back into slumber again after a
very long time (311,040,000,000,000 years), in order to become truth in new life (reincarnation) as new cre-
ational form; all things existing on the earths (worlds/planets) and in the firmaments (universe) is the act (work)
of the Creation, and its BEING is spiritual primal power which is also given as a minuscule part in your inner
world (consciousness); and your inner world (consciousness) can be called on by you in intercession in order to
improve yourselves through your own strivings in all virtues and in the character, as well as in the individual
being (personality) and the conduct (behaviour); however, the inner world (consciousness) cannot be asked for
worldly help and things of value and the like, nor can they be obtained from it, just as this cannot be requested
from any invented god or tin gods either; and you may speak to, intercede with and call on your spirit (prayer
to your own spirit or directly to the consciousness), but your speaking and calling will be perceived by your
inner world (consciousness) through which your swelling (evolution) is given when you strive for this knowingly
and wisely.
  363) Your inner world (consciousness) is knowing in many things, but you do not want to understand anything of its knowledge, except what appeals to you and gives you mirth in festivities, pleasures and amusements.
  364) There shall not be any coercion in the knowledge about the truth and the truth-teaching, but nevertheless it
shall be clearly distinguishable in all things in the sense of right and unright, so that no one lets himself or her-
self be guided (led) by the malefactors (lawbreakers) who curse the truth and disregard it; therefore may
everyone who is searching for the truth have a strong head (rationality) that knows no breaking in order to
decide knowingly and willingly between the coercion to a belief or the freedom of the knowledge of the truth
and the truth-teaching.
  365) The real truth stands at all times in good friendship with those who are knowing of the truth and continuously leads them from every twilight into light; those, however, who are caught up in a belief in a god or tin gods and
  are malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth of the Creation and its laws and recommendations and in
  the teaching of the proclaimers, the prophets, to them the truth and the truth-teaching is open so that they may learn and find the way to true life; and if the malefactors against the truth believe themselves to be enemies of those who are knowing of the truth, then those who have knowledge of the truth are not their enemies, be- cause truly they are always striving to lead those committing an outrage against the truth out of the darkness of their unknowledgeness and into the light of the truth in friendship, so that they do not have to remain in the fire of unknowledgeness.
  366) No one who is knowing of the truth dares to dispute the truth and the truth-teaching of the laws and recom-
mendations of the Creation, as has been given by the proclaimers, the prophets, since time immemorial;
through their own power and their own efforts, those who are knowing of the truth have created the cogni-
tion of the truth in themselves through the teaching of the proclaimers, the prophets, and their teaching of
the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the life and have given themselves the opportunity to lead their
present existence in accordance with the true laws and recommendations of the Creation.
  367) The real truth of the laws and recommendations of the Creation is bringing forth life in the right measure and
not killing (murdering), as you people of your kind (human beings) shall bring forth life in the right measure
(begetting offspring in the right measure) and not kill (murder); however, if you contravene the recommenda-
tion and bring forth life beyond the right measure and you also kill (murder) in Ausartung, then you are ones
without equitableness (unfair ones/inequitable ones/irresponsible ones) and you are casting yourselves into
hardship and evil and misery.
  368) If you kill (murder) life and destroy things of the people of your kind (human beings), then they cannot be given
back, because you do not have the might to do so, just as you do not have the might to bring forth once more
or rebuild in the same wise and with the same form the things that you have destroyed; every killed (murdered)
life escapes from the body and cannot return, because a return is only given for the form of the spirit which
escapes into the realm of the invisible (other world/death-life) and is reborn when the time for a new inner
world (consciousness) and for a new individual being (personality) has come, without equivalence with the
deceased inner world (consciousness) or to the deceased individual being (personality).
  369) And the truth of the return of the spirit in a new person of your kind (human being/new consciousness, new
all-of-yourself [personality] and new material body), after the preceding person of your kind (human being) has
died, may be for you a sign (evidence) of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the
truth (Creation); and it is through the laws and recommendations of the wellspring of the truth that living and
dying and death and therefore the return of the spirit in a new body of a new person of your kind (human
being) are possible, just as everything is possible and nothing is impossible which originates from the might of
the laws and recommendations.
  370) And consider, there is neither a god nor tin gods nor people of your kind (human beings) and demons or either
liberators (angels) and venerable ones (holy ones) who can reanimate a dead person (deceased person), be-
cause when someone dies the spirit escapes into the realm of invisibility (other world) and cannot return to the
deceased body because this is irreversibly connected to death.
  371) Be certain (knowing) that if you give your goods and chattels and wealth from your strongbox (savings) and
alms (gifts) in an appropriate measure for the purpose of the truth without harming yourselves in these things,
then you are the same as a seed of corn that grows seven ears and has one hundred grains in every ear, be-
cause in this wise you multiply the teaching of the truth through your gifts for everyone who spreads it, and
also for those who want to recognise it and be connected to it; and make donations according to your sense
and whatever is right for you, then you are gracious to the unknowing ones who are searching for the truth
and to those who are in need of alms (gifts).
  372) But do not give your goods and chattels and alms (gifts) from your wealth from the strongbox (savings) if in
your giving you are following with reproach or contempt (insult/outrage), for which you will not find any good
reward, and the fear will come over you as well as the shame rising red in your face and sorrow will befall you
on the day of the impulsation of admonishment (conscience).
  373) If you give a gracious word and give forgiveness in honesty, then that is better than a present given in dis -
honourableness intended to bring reconciliation; a good word and a respectfully presented forgiveness are
given in honesty, but a present is commonplace (impersonal) and valueless without a word of kindheartedness
and forgiveness; because no matter how excessive (expensive/precious) the present may be, it is nevertheless
no more than a honourless giving of alms for false reconciliation; a true and good word and honourable for-
giveness are evidence of forbearance and one's own contentment (modesty) as well as of peaceableness; an
unhonest present for reconciliation gives rise to contempt (insult/outrage), both in the one who gives it and in
the one who takes it, with enmity and hatred originating therefrom.
  374) And if you give alms, do not make yourselves conceited with your giving by allowing contempt (insult/outrage) and reproach to prevail by reviling those to whom the alms are intended; therefore do not donate in the sense
  of being wealthy so that people of your kind (human beings) see it, because you want to show off (vaunt your-
  selves/boast/brag) and believe that you are placed above (superior to) those to whom you are giving alms; but
  if you do not comply with this recommendation and act against it then you will be the same as a smooth rock
  covered with loose soil upon which a heavy downpour of rain falls, thereby revealing its smoothness and hard- ness; and if this is done then nothing of significance (merit) will be carried away because the people of your kind (human beings) do not like those who are without equitableness (unfair ones/irresponsible ones) and who raise themselves above them and demean them with unhonest and calculating almsgiving.
  375) And those among you who give your goods and chattels and your wealth in striving for the delight of a god
or tin gods invented by yourselves, as well as for the desire (lust/comfortable feeling) of one of your kind
(human being), a liberator (angel) or venerable one (holy one) or a demon, then you will still not receive any
strengthening, but will suffer loss because you are building your house on sand which will be blown away by
a strong wind leading to the collapse of the house; and if you build on sand then you lose twofold, namely your
goods and chattels and your wealth as well as your honour and dignity, because your loss gives rise to mali-
cious gossip.
  376) In the sense of your knowledge of the truth-teaching, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the
teaching of the life, create for yourselves a large garden with vegetables, plants, trees and shrubs which are
full of the fruits of wisdom and love, peace, freedom and consonance (harmony); make sure that no weak off-
spring arise from the seeds, but that love and knowledge and wisdom multiply in you; do not allow any fiery
whirlwind to blow through your garden of your love and of knowledge as well as of wisdom, so that every-
thing which you have arduously acquired through your learning will not be scorched; take heed and follow the
recommendation so that you do not fall back into unknowledgeness.
  377) Donate from all the good things that you have acquired and acquire, and from all that which is brought forth
to you through the earth so that no one might suffer in need; give alms (gifts) and good things according to
your wealth, but do not search out the poor things for this that you would yourselves not take; turn a blind
eye when giving alms and good things for the needy, so that you will not be overwhelmed by stinginess and
so that you do rightfully; and consider, the one who is self-sufficient is the dignified one and will be treated
with esteem.
  378) It is only your stinginess and your foolishness that warn you against poverty and command you to do shame-
ful things if you sadden and torment yourselves about alms and good gifts that you shall give; be rightfully fru-
gal (modest) and do not hoard goods and chattels and possessions and wealth for the sake of might, but do
it for the sake of right, in order to help the needy who require your assistance, alms and good things.
  379) Also be respectful to the poor and needy, and give them alms and good things in right measure according to your wealth and possessions, and when doing so consider that you will not be able to take one thing to the
  realm of the invisible (other world/death-life) from all that which you have gathered together in terms of goods
  and chattels and possessions and wealth, because there are no pockets in which you could take anything with you.
  380) If you have a woman or a man or offspring when you die, then whilst you are still living, divide up your goods
and chattels, your possessions and wealth through an apportionment (testament) set in writing so that after
your passing everything will be regulated and everyone will receive the portion that is intended for him or her;
consider that the apportionment (testament) shall be rightful and equitable (fair), therefore it shall be that
when there are sons and daughters, that the surviving woman or the surviving man shall receive two thirds of
the goods and chattels, possessions and wealth, and the third portion shall be shared equally between the sur-
viving sons and daughters; and if the woman or the man survives and there are no offspring, then the surviv-
ing woman or man shall receive all of the goods and chattels, as well as all of the possessions and wealth; and
it shall not be the case that a surviving woman, a surviving man or surviving children shall be deprived of their
due portion (inheritance) because of disputes and the like; and if there is no apportionment (testament) set
down in writing, then the jurisdiction is to decide on the distribution in accordance with the sense of the
recommendation, as the recommendation is given; if an offspring – daughter or son – dies who is not in a
bond of marriage and does not have any offspring, then his or her goods and chattels, possessions and wealth
shall revert to the parents; if a woman or a man dies and neither a woman nor a man nor offspring are left
surviving, then a written apportionment (testament) shall be given as to how the goods and chattels, posses-
sions and wealth shall be used; if, however, there is no apportionment (testament) then all the possessions (the
whole inheritance) fall to the people and are administered by the authority.
  381) Impart to those from your knowledge and from your wisdom who ask about them and want them; and if you
impart to those who want your knowledge and your wisdom then you are truly giving rich goods, and every-
one will think about them in honour and use their understanding in order to comprehend them.
  382) Whatever you may give and whatever vow you may make to help other people and to teach them the truth, it will be repaid a thousand times over by those who esteem your help and your knowledge and your wisdom.
  383) If you give alms publicly and do good deeds, this is certainly good and meritorious, but if you do it in secret
and thereby help the poor and needy, then that is better and more honourable for you, because what you do
secretly in this wise shows your modesty and kindheartedness which you do not want to display before the
people in order to shine before them and be praised by them.
384) And whatever alms and goods you donate, do not donate them for the sake of your appearance; not to stand
 in the light of the people and not to be regarded as something that you are not; donate alms and goods in
 modesty and out of your kindheartedness and your honest benevolence in modesty; and giving alms and good
 things to the poor and needy is a sublime (noble) virtue; and what you donate to the poor and needy in terms
 of alms and good things will be amply repaid to you with the goods of love and through a good conscience,
 so that you will experience happiness and joyfulness, however not suffer any disadvantage.
385) Alms and good gifts for the poor and needy are all-timely for those who are defined as (verifiably) living in
 poverty and need, and those who are incapable of earning their bread themselves; alms and good gifts are
 also for the old who are infirm and can no longer do anything of importance (work); the unknowing ones
 amongst you believe that those defined as poor and needy as well as the old and infirm are free from need if
 they refrain from demanding (begging); you may recognise the truly honest poor and needy and the aged and
 infirm by their appearance (conduct), because they do not ask importunately and they direct their eyes to the
 ground in humiliation (shamefacedness).
386) And those among you who give from their goods and chattels, from their possessions and wealth to the poor
 and needy, to the aged and infirm, and who do it day and night, secretly and known (publicly) and in good
 modesty and honourable benevolence, their reward will be thanks and esteem, and no fear shall befall them
 because of their good deeds, nor shall they suffer because of them.
387) It is not your responsibility if the unknowing ones and inequitable ones (irresponsible ones/unfair ones) do not
 follow the right way, in order not to be connected to the truth-teaching and the laws and recommendations
 of the formation (Creation), because you can only give them benevolent advice and instruction, but how they
 guide (lead) themselves is a matter of their own volition.
388) Anyone who undertakes haggling (usury/greed) in any form of commerce and unrightfully demands a markup
 (interest or price increase) shall be exposed to the punishment of recompense through the authority or juris-
 diction, so that the disadvantaged ones do not suffer any loss of goods and chattels, possessions and fortune;
 in commerce involving goods and things, the markup (interest or price increase) shall be regulated and defined
 by the authority according to the goods or things and their value; however, if hagglers (avaricious ones/usurers)
 and inequitable ones (irresponsible ones/unfair ones) taking a markup (interest) are not understanding and they
 continuously repeat their outrageous and fallible behaviour against the given demand (instruction/regulation/
 directive) of the authority, then they are given over to the jurisdiction for the fulfilment of guidelines which is
 the separation from the people (society) for a certain time.
389) Commerce may well permit taking a markup (interest or price increase) to an equitable (admissible/fair) extent,
 however it shall not be permitted for additions (interest or price markup) to be taken to a dishonourable and
 excessive extent; therefore whoever receives a reminder from someone taking a markup (taking interest) for
 payment that has an addition of a dishonourable and excessive amount shall refrain from paying this and call
 on the authority or jurisdiction to decide that to the fallible one taking the markup (taking the interest) shall
 only remain as punishment the value without markup (interest or price increase) that he himself gave for the
 purchase as settlement (payment), so that he may not obtain any profit for this.
390) Taking a markup (interest or price increase) shall not be abolished, but shall serve to conduct honest commerce
 so that even someone trading in one commodity may receive an equitable (fair/appropriate) reward through
 honest revenue; but truly, the people does not love anyone who practises haggling (usury/greed) in commerce
 and takes a unrightful markup (interest or price increase).
391) And if anybody demonstrably falls into great need and cannot settle (pay for) the commercial good, then drop
 the markup (interest or price increase) and only take the price that you yourselves have paid; it is better not to
 make any profit than to bring harm and inequity on another through greed; this is what you shall do, because
 you shall not do unright, but if you do not follow this recommendation then you will suffer from your unright
 in your admonishment (conscience).
392) And if a debtor falls into difficulty, then grant him an extension until it is once again easy for him or her to settle
 the debt; however, if the debtor falls into difficulty with very great hardship and he or she can no longer settle
 the debt, then act in rationality, thus you take back the commercial item if it is extensive, but leave it as a good
 deed if it is not of great value.
393) Guard yourselves against pinning your hopes and wishes too high on a judgement if you have to call on juris-
 diction or authorities in a transaction (deal) or in conflict (dispute/enmity), in order to ask for arbitration in a
 case, because in spite of being in the right, you will scarcely receive your full reward according to your signifi-
 cance (merit), but only a partial reward, so you will think that something unright has happened to you and this
 will make you joyless; but consider that every jurisdiction reaches a judgement according to its own legal guide -
 lines (criteria) which do not correspond to your wishes and hopes which you have set out in advance; it may
 very well be that the jurisdiction agrees that you are in the right, if this is the case, but you suffer some loss in
 any case because you pin your hopes and wishes too highly.
394) If you take a loan (credit) from another for a particular term and with an honest markup (interest rate), then set it down firmly in writing, and if you cannot write yourselves then have it written down truly by a scribe in
your presence, however only in the presence of two other righteous (conscientious) bystanders (witnesses) who are also versed in writing, so that the one does not write anything that is not the truth and does not corre- spond to the agreement; and no one who is versed in the script shall refuse to write, because everyone who is versed in the script shall provide this service to those who do not know how to write for a small but appro- priate payment; therefore have the scribe perform the writing and have the one who is entering into the under- taking (obligation) say to the scribe what he or she has to write, and say that he or she must not falsify or defraud anything; however, if the one entering into the undertaking (obligation) is of low intellect or weak or incapable of instructing what has to be written, then someone who looks after his or her affairs says in hon- esty and equitableness (fairness) what must be recorded in writing; and the witnesses shall not refuse to attend when they are called on; and do not disdain to write down everything precisely whether it be much or little, and together with the defined term (period for repayment); and do not make the bystanders (witnesses) and the scribes into fallible ones, and do not bring any disadvantage (forfeiture/damage) on them if the one who gives out the loan (credit) does not stick to the agreement and has to be brought before the jurisdiction; and it is also permitted for the one giving the loan (creditor/credit giver) to demand a contribution (loan deposit) of a rightful amount as collateral and contingency (deposit) which shall become his or her property if the loan (credit) is not repaid by a redemption (repayment).
395) And if something is entrusted to someone in contingency (deposit), then the one to whom it is entrusted shall
 hand back (issue/give back) what has been entrusted when it is demanded back rightfully; if what has been
 entrusted in contingency (deposit) is concealed (hidden/not given back/denied) then the bystanders (witnesses)
 shall present their justification (evidence); if what was entrusted in contingency (deposit) is nevertheless con-
 cealed, then the authority or jurisdiction shall be called upon.
396) If you undertake a transaction from hand to hand and the goods are small, then you shall not be obliged to
 issue a receipt, but when you undertake a transaction with great goods, then you shall be bound by the obli-
 gation of a receipt.
397) And always have bystanders (witnesses) if you offer one another anything for sale and sell so that everything
 is done in honesty and nothing occurs that is unright.
398) Truly, when you are knowing in the truth and you do good works in respect and honesty, and carry out your
 duty, and if you give your alms and good gifts to those who need them, then your reward will be love and
 equitableness (fairness), and therefore you will not have to fear that anyone will revile you as a stingy one or
 someone without equitableness (unfair one/irresponsible one), nor that others will cause sorrow in you.
399) To you is granted everything that is in the firmaments (universe) and on the earth-roundness (Earth), as well as
 everything that is in you and whatever you make known; therefore do your part (responsibility); and if you do
 any things which you shall not do because they are wrong and against the right and against the laws and
 recommendations of the wellspring of the love (Creation), then you will have to give account; and if the mis-
 deed you have committed can be forgiven, then forgiveness shall be granted to you, but if you cannot be for-
 given because your misdeed breaks the bounds of all right, then you will be subjected to punishment by the
 authority or jurisdiction so that you will be subjected to the fulfilment of guidelines and the possibility of com-
 pensation.
400) Know about all these laws and recommendations that have been revealed to you by the proclaimers, the prophets,
 so that you may heed the right and outlaw (proscribe) the unright; and consider that in right and unright everyone
 shall be equal without difference, so no one shall be advantaged and the other disadvantaged, therefore the poor
 like the rich and the equitable ones (fair ones/responsible ones) and the dissemblers (deceivers), as well as the ones
 who are knowing of the truth and the ones who are unknowing of the truth will be assessed equally in all things,
 thus in freedom as well as when called to account.
401) And no one shall be imposed upon beyond their capability (abilities/strengths); and to everyone shall be awarded
 what is due to him or her and what appertains to him or her, irrespective of whether he or she has lost control
 over himself or herself and committed an offence or whether he or she carries out everything rightfully and in
 respect and honesty; and no one may place his or her responsibility onto another, neither onto gods and tin gods,
 but everyone shall take their responsibility upon themselves and come under it; and there is no one who has not
 been given the power to do what is rightful and of responsibility.
