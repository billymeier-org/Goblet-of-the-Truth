# Chapter 6
1) Deference is the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), which is the creation of all firmaments (universe) and earths (worlds/planets), of the darkness and the light, but there are many amongst you who place other things as
equal to the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), principally fabulated (conceived/invented) gods and tin
gods, because you are unknowing in the truth and only lend your ear to (believe in) lies and slanders (calumnies).
2) You have proceeded from the might (idea) of the primal wellspring of all life (Creation); and it is through it that
 your destination is determined which you shall reach through the unbidden (voluntarily) unfolding (evolution)
 of your inner world (consciousness), so that you become one in a bond (agreement) with it (becoming one
 with Creation) in the very distant time to come (future).
3) Therefore, your destination in the very distant time to come (future = eons of years) is determined, which you
 shall however reach in unbiddenness (voluntariness) over considerable (many) existences (lives) that you will
 have again and again as new people of your kind (personalities) after you have died and are called back into
 existence (life) through your spirit-body (spirit-form).
4) And truly, it is the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) that has given its laws and recommendations for
 all firmaments (universe) and for the earths (worlds/planets) so that everywhere and in all things, externally and
 internally, everything is given so and as everything is necessary.
 5) And nothing comes to you without you bringing it forth yourselves, whether it be love or unlove, peace or un-
 peace, hatred, pathological craving for revenge and pathological craving for retaliation, suspicion, battle (war)
 or freedom and unfreedom (bondage) and everything that can be imagined, because truly, all signs (activities)
 of the signs (destiny) which come are created by you yourselves, both in the good and in the evil.
6) And if you reject the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation),
 as they are recognisable to you if you go forth with open eyes, then you will yourselves become knowing of
 what you are mocking.
7) Look back from yourselves (into the past), and you will recognise how many peoples and species (family/clan)
 have eradicated themselves or have been eradicated by others; they had firm residences on Earth, but they al-
 lowed clouds (strife/war) to grow over themselves and allowed streams of rain (spilling of blood) to befall them-
 selves and they swam therein until they drowned (died out); and their residences and their places (cities/vil-
 lages) were destroyed and everything eradicated that bore witness to them; but after them came other peoples
 and species (families/clans), but they did the same as their predecessors.
8) And truly, even before you there came true prophets to your fore-forefathers and fore-foremothers (fore-fore-
 bears/forebears before them), long before the true prophets from the line of the seven from the line of Noko-
 demion came to your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) in order to instruct them in the truth
 of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), but they rejected and slan-
 dered (calumniated) and falsified the teaching of the prophets; and the same was done by those scribes who
 were instructed by the prophets to put the teaching into writing (write down/record it) so that their work was
 merely lies and deception; and truly, if the prophets had written the writing themselves and if your forefathers
 and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) had felt with their hands or read the writing, if they had been capable
 of writing (reading/had not been illiterate ones) then in their unknowledgeness of the truth and in their self-
 deception (self-delusion) of suggestive trickery (magic), they would have attacked (accused) the work of the
 prophets as being evident activities of the shadow world (activities of hell) and would have killed (murdered)
 the true prophets as servants of the devil, so the matter would not have rested with willingness (striving) for
 persecution and killing.
9) If the true prophets had brought the writing of the truth-teaching to your fore-forefathers and forefathers and
 to your fore-foremothers and foremothers (fore-forebears/forebears before them/ancestors/forebears) if they
 had been capable of reading, then they would have considered this to be the work of the devil because it
 would not have been a writing by their scribes and would not have been accepted; therefore it is recommen-
 ded to you that you learn at first hand (directly) from the true prophets and from the true handed-down knowl-
 edge; but beware of the false handed-down knowledge of the scribes because their teachings are falsified and
 far from all truthliness; but the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vi-
 talities (Creation) shall be given to you in good word (language) and in clear writing as the source (book) of
 the truth when the last true prophet of the line of Nokodemion teaches the teaching of the truth, the teaching
 of the spirit, the teaching of the life so that it may remain word-for-word in its expression (explanation/presen-
 tation) and may be understandable to you, because then in the new time you are literate (capable of reading
 and writing) and understand the words of the teaching of the prophets so that miscomprehension (misunder-
 standings) vanish from you.
10) Truly, the source of wisdom (book of wisdom) could be given to you by a true prophet already before that far-
 off time, then it would be if it were to be feasible (possible), but the possibility can only be if the necessary
 contingencies (conditions) will be given so that the source of wisdom (book of wisdom) reaches the hands of
 all those who are ready for it; therefore it is still necessary to give you a deferment until the new time, how-
 ever after that you will no longer be able to trot out the usual pretexts (excuses) that you had not been brought
 the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) in the form
 of the teaching of the prophets as the ‹Goblet of the Truth›.
11) And truly, if it had been determined that more true prophets would come to you, then they would have ap -
 peared to you but not as fabulated (invented) liberators (angels) or as supposed envoys of gods and tin gods,
 because true prophets are people of your kind (human beings) and therefore also in the shape of people of
 your kind (human form); therefore true prophets cannot appear to you as higher Wesenheiten, because this
 would merely make you more confused than you already are.
12) However, just as your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) before you mocked the true prophets
 and lent their ear (believed in) the false prophets, so you are doing the same; but by mocking the true prophets,
 you are only mocking yourselves.
13) Truly, walk over the earth and see how miserable has been the end of those who treated the true prophets as
 liars; and walk over the earth and look how people of your kind (fellow human beings) are at present wal-
 lowing in unright and killing, in jealousy, hatred, lovelessness and battle (war) and do not know either peace
 or freedom or consonance (harmony) because they do not follow the teaching of the prophets and they treat
 them as liars, persecute them, slander (calumniate) them, dishonour them and strive to kill them.
 14) But consider that the true prophets do not allow themselves to be driven forth from you, rather they grant you
 forgiveness for what you do to them and continue to fulfil their duty that they take (load) on themselves unbid-
 den (voluntarily) in order to instruct you, you who deprave your thoughts and your feelings, in the teaching of
 the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life; and there is no doubt about the righteousness
 (conscientiousness) of the true prophets.
15) Truly, everything that dwells and moves in the night and day belongs to the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation), but all is given to you by it so that you may look after it and bring it to blossom.
16) Through the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), through the cre-
 ation of the firmaments (universe) and the earths (worlds/planets), which itself enjoys nothing of food and
 drink such as you need them, everything is given to you which you need for life, food and drink and every-
 thing that you desire.
17) And through the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), it is recom-
 mended to you that you dedicate yourselves to the guidelines (guiding rules) of the laws and recommenda -
 tions so that you may be all faithful to the laws and faithful to the recommendations and that there may be
 none amongst you who places fabulated (invented) gods or tin gods or people of your kind (human beings) as
 gods or emissaries of god or as representatives (substitutes) at the side of the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation).
18) Truly, you shall be afraid of what you do that is unrightful, because in its good time all your unright will have
 an effect on yourselves; if you do not follow the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vital-
 ities (Creation) then you are acting (living) falsely towards your innermost (nature of the spirit), so that you form
 your inner nature falsely and are disobedient to yourselves.
19) If you remain saved from your own disobedience, if you turn to the truth of the laws and recommendations
 of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), then you are bestowing yourselves benevolence and an open
 blissful happiness.
20) However, if you turn away from the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vital-
 ities (Creation), then do not be surprised if you are pursued by unfortune, such as no people of your kind (fel-
 low human beings) can take away from you, so it pursues you until you become rightful and become connected
 to the truth; and if you are willing to make a bond with the truth then you will be touched by happiness,
 because it has the might to give you your inner peace, freedom and consonance (harmony) so that you may
 also live in love and take joy in your own existence (life).
21) The truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) does not demand
 that you be subservient to it in submissiveness or be its servants (hands/helpers), rather it recommends that you
 become knowing ones (ones who have knowledge) and wise ones in uncoercedness (voluntariness) by dedi-
 cating your existence (life) to the truth.
22) And if you ask yourselves what thing is for you the most important proof of your existence (life), then you rec-
 ognise the truth in the truliness (irrefutability) in all things of the existence and the witness of the primal well-
 spring of all vitalities (Creation).
23) And these things are obvious (recognisable) to you through the teaching of the prophets, through the ‹Goblet
 of the Truth›, so that you may understand and so that you are all warned through the teaching against doing
 things that are unrightful; and the truth-teaching is given so that it reaches everyone amongst you who want
 to be reached by it.
24) And truly, you cannot really bear witness to the existence of other mights that are equal to the primal well- spring of all vitalities (Creation); and if you place gods and tin gods or people of your kind (human beings) next
to the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), then all of that is only the work of people of your kind (work
of human beings); and truly, if gods or tin gods are named then they are only people of your kind (human beings)
to whom a high designation (title) of god or tin god has been imputed and bestowed (awarded), but truly
these cannot be set as the equivalent of or placed next to the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation); truly,
the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is the only one of its nature (kind/form), and it is far from (be -
yond) all those things, gods and tin gods and people of your kind (human beings) which you place at its side.
25) Those amongst you to whom the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life is
 given and who with your daughters and sons recognise (see) the truth and follow it, you will live in gladness and
 fulfil (master) your existence (life) in deference (venerability), but those amongst you who do not follow the truth,
 you are depraving yourselves in yourselves and you are unsatisfied with everything that is given to you through
 the existence (life).
26) And who is more unfair (more irresponsible) than those amongst you who concoct lies against the truth of the
 laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and against the primal wellspring
 of all vitalities (Creation) itself, and you who accuse its signs (unsurpassabilities) of being lies which you can
 recognise (see) in their appearance (nature)?
 27) And if you turn to the truth, then ask yourselves because you recognise the truth, how it can be that people
 of your kind (human beings) pray to fabulated gods and tin gods and people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) who pass themselves off as their representatives (substitutes) or servants (hands/helpers), since no gods
 or tin gods and no people of your kind (human beings) as their representatives (substitutes) can be placed next
 to the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), because it is sublime over all things.
28) Truly, it is only when you start to liberate yourselves from the enticement of your false prophet and false teach-
 ings that you recognise that you were servants of gods and servants of tin gods and prayed to insubstantiali-
 ties; and only then do you recognise that you once again not only are lying against the truth but that you are
 lying to yourselves and are slandering (calumniating) yourselves, which is why everything that you concoct
 unrightfully betrays (abandons) you.
29) Truly, amongst you there are many who listen to the truth and yet have placed a veil over your true discern-
 ment (intellect) so that you cannot understand, and you have shut up your ears with deafness so that you can-
 not hear the truth in its value, and even if you see the signs (evidence) of the truth with your eyes, then you
 place a veil over it so that you cannot see truly, because you are fighting in yourselves against the truth and
 the untruth, with the effect that you cannot overcome the inner resistance and decide for the real truth and
 finally explain (teach) everything merely as fables of the old ones.
30) And those amongst you who hypocritically boast of having knowledge of the truth and yet do not act accord-
 ing to it, because you keep yourselves far from it, you dare to forbid people of your kind (fellow human beings)
 to turn to the truth, therefore you are casting people of your kind (fellow human beings) into ruin just as your-
 selves; it is just that you do not understand it.
31) If you could only see how you are placing yourselves into the fire of inequity (unfairness) then you would wish
 that you could turn back to the truth, although you are deprived of this because you treat the signs (evidence)
 of the truth as lies and are believers in godliness (religion) and its gods and tin gods.
32) And those amongst you who have turned to the truth but have not yet become clear about what you used to
 conceal (falsify and deny) with regard to the truth, you are constantly on the edge of the abyss (run the risk)
 of returning to forbidden things (falling back into unknowledgeness) and once again becoming ample liars and
 slanderers (calumniators) of the truth if you do not strengthen yourselves in what has been proclaimed
 (announced) to you through the truth-teaching.
33) And be certain (knowing) that there is no other life than the corporeal (earthly) one and therefore the mortal
 life in which you can fulfil (master) your conscientiousness (duty) in ample obligation (responsibility) for your un-
 folding (evolution) for your inner world (consciousness); and when you die then you cannot be re-awakened,
 because your inner world (consciousness) and your all-of-yourself (personality) is dissolved into unsubstantial
 activity (energy) from which a new all-of-yourself (personality) and a new inner world (consciousness) is formed
 and born, together with the reawakening (rebirth/reincarnation) of the spirit-body (spirit-form).
34) And the other life after dying is the death-life in the world of invisibility (other world), and you cannot either
 see or grasp it because it is of fineness (fine-fluidalness), and the world (sphere/level) of the incorporeal (spiri-
 tual) is of unearthly appearance (nature).
35) Truly, you shall be knowing (conscious) in the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life, so that you are not losers and do not deny the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal
 wellspring of all vitalities (Creation); be knowing (conscious) in the truth, so that the hour does not come on
 you unexpectedly when woe befalls you because you neglected the truth and the truth-teaching and you have
 to carry a heavy load on your back under which you collapse because you are too heavily loaded with unright
 and unrighteousness (consciencelessness), with inequity (unfairness) and virtuelessness.
36) Life in this world is not a game and no pastime, but an existence (life) for the fulfilment of the conscientious-
 ness (duty) in obligation (responsibility), to give fullness (satisfaction) to the unfolding (evolving) of the inner
 world (consciousness) and for creating knowledge and wisdom as well as love and peace and consonance (har-
 mony) and freedom; truly, you should understand this.
37) You are sad in your thoughts and feelings, and you become enraged if the truth is proclaimed (announced) to
 you through the true prophets, therefore you accuse them of falseness (deviousness) and deny the signs (mar-
 vels) that they do as activities of the shadow world (activities of hell) and outrages (crimes) against your fabu-
 lated (invented) gods and tin gods.
38) Truly, in your unknowledge about the truth you have since time immemorial accused the truth-teaching and the prophets as being fallacious, and you also do the same thing today; but despite your persecution and slan-
der (calumny), they remained patient, as they still remain patient today and give you their help and teach you
the teaching of the prophets; and truly, there is not one amongst you who could change even one word of
the truth of the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation),
so the tidings of the teaching of the prophets will remain preserved for all time as the ‹Goblet of the Truth›.
39) And when your own unwillingness towards the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching
 of the life becomes painful to you, then it seems to you as if you were sinking into a deep shaft in the earth;
 however if you find willingness and gratification in the truth-teaching, then it is to you as if you had found a
 ladder leading to the firmaments (universe) and were receiving signs (evidence) of the truth from there; there-
 fore it is your will to decide whether you will sink into the earth because of your unknowledge or whether you
 will climb into the firmaments (universe) through your truth-knowledge and the love and consonance (harmo-
 ny) that proceeds out it as well as the freedom and peace in yourselves.
40) And truly, you can only listen and absorb (learn) as long as you are alive (connected to the truth and knowing),
 but when you are dead (not connected to the truth and unknowing) then you cannot listen and cannot absorb
 (learn), therefore you must awaken yourselves to the truth first so that you may become alive (connected to
 the truth and knowing).
41) Truly, you cannot say that no signs (evidence) have been given to you through the prophets regarding the
 teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because they have been given to you
 on many occasions, as the truth-teaching has been proclaimed (announced) to you time and time again, but
 you have treated it with contempt and are now obliged to search for it anew.
42) And you have been taught that all animals and other creatures on Earth are collectives just as you, so each bird
 that flies on its wings, and each fish that swims as well as every animal that runs and countless others that
 crawl and fly.
43) Those amongst you, however, who do not heed these things and reject the signs (evidence) of the truth, you
 are deaf and dumb in yourselves and you live in darkness in your inner world (consciousness) without knowl-
 edge, love and wisdom, and without peace, freedom and consonance (harmony), because you are going into
 confusion and are refusing to walk on the right way which leads you to the light of the truth.
44) Consider your existence (life) in all things so that you are not sad and not full of fear when the hour (death)
 catches up with you, so that you may pass away (die) in peace and joy.
45) Truly, when your hour (death) comes then you will call for the truth, but you will not forget what evil and ter-
 rible things you have done in your life, therefore you will pass away (die) in fear.
46) Be certain (knowing) that you will always be rewarded according to how you lead your life in all things, be-
 cause whatever you take in your hand (do), you create your own reward with it; this is given through the laws
 and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) so that you may receive your reward
 in equitableness (fairness) according to how you conduct (care for) your thoughts and feelings and how you
 carry out your deeds.
47) Therefore consider that it is you yourselves who form your foreordination (destiny), therefore it is not the laws
 and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) because they merely advise you what
 results as gain (activity) from the wellspring of power (cause); truly, you alone form everything therefore you
 create tribulation and misery for yourselves and humiliate yourselves if you do not heed and follow the guide-
 lines (basic rules) of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation).
48) There is no law and no recommendation of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) that demands sub-
 missiveness or other subservience from you, because submissiveness is a punishable disparagement (contempt-
 ibility) that is only demanded by people of your kind (human beings) for people of your kind (fellow human
 beings) in order to keep you in abasement (subservience/servitude) so that you can be exploited in every pos-
 sible wise; and truly, as the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and its laws and recommendations do
 not demand submissiveness from you, neither do they demand any punishment for what you do in inequity
 (unfairness) and unrighteousness (consciencelessness) as well as in virtuelessness and in unknowledge of the
 truth, because what punishment you suffer is what you inflict on yourselves when you harden your thoughts
 and feelings and your inner world (consciousness) as well as your psyche because in yourselves you consider
 everything evil as well done (convenience) and are willingly devoted to it.
49) Truly, you continually forget what admonishments are granted to you through the teaching of the truth, the
 teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, which opens the gateway of all things (knowledge and wisdom)
 to you so that you can comprehend (understand) everything, so that you can take joy in all things and do not
 cast yourselves into darkness (despair).
50) Do not be malefactors (irresponsible ones) against the truth, neither as a people nor as a single one (individ-
 ual), but obtain for yourselves the gain (reward) that comes forth to you from the laws and recommendations
 of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) if you follow them.
51) If your hearing and your face (eyesight) were taken away and your inner world (consciousness) sealed, then you would be deaf and blind and without thoughts and feelings, and no-one could give you the teaching of
the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, because you could not hear anything, see any-
thing or comprehend (understand) anything in true discernment (intellect); but even without your hearing and
your face (eyesight) being taken away and without your inner world (consciousness) being sealed, so that you
can hear and see and use your true discernment (intellect), you still turn away from the teaching of the truth
and do not heed the manifold signs (evidence) which are given to you through the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and through its appearance (nature).
52) If an unexpected and evident punishment were meted out on you through the primal wellspring of all vitali-
 ties (Creation) or through its laws and recommendations, as people of your kind (human beings) mete out
 punishment on people of your kind (fellow human beings), then you would be destroyed as a people and as
 single ones (individual ones); but the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is fair and does not mete out
 punishment on its creatures and creations, because punishment is a concoction (invention) by people of your
 kind (human beings) in deviancy and Ausartung.
53) Truly, you can learn these things through the teaching of the prophets who bring their knowledge and their
 wisdom to you as the ‹Goblet of the Truth›; but the true prophets are not envoys of fabulated (invented) gods
 or tin gods, rather they have arisen from themselves (from their own determination) so that they are for you
 bringers of joyful messages and are warners for you for what you do that is of terribleness and inequity (unfair-
 ness), as well as of unrightness and virtuelessness by which you create unlove, unfreedom (bondage), disso-
 nance (disharmony) and unpeace and jealousy, as well as hatred, revenge and retaliation, killing, battle (war),
 destruction and outrage (crime) and other lawlessness.
54) Those amongst you, however, who follow the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitali- ties (Creation) and the laws and recommendations of people of your kind (society), no fear and no sorrow shall
come over you through misdemeanours against the standing rules and regulations, because you allow your-
selves to be led (guided) by the guideline (guidance) of the laws and recommendations; those amongst you,
however, who reject the signs (evidence) of the truth and of the laws and recommendations, you will be
brought to account through yourselves and through a punishment of the jurisdiction for your disobedience.
55) Truly, in the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and in its laws and recommendations there are all the treasures that you can imagine, but they remain hidden to you until you turn to them and follow them.
56) And if you turn and follow the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation),
 then your inner world (consciousness) will be open and will recognise the truth of all truth, therefore you will
 also recognise that the true prophets are not liberators (angels) and not envoys of fabulated (invented) gods
 and tin gods, but that they are people of your kind (human beings) as you are yourselves, and that their
 knowledge and their wisdom has not been disclosed to them by gods or tin gods, rather that they fathom out
 (work out) everything themselves by learning the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all
 vitalities (Creation) and of its appearance (nature) in true discernment (intellect); and truly, you cannot match
 one another in your and their knowledge and in your and their wisdom, because you are the blind ones and
 the true prophets are the seeing ones, even though they do not raise themselves up above you (threaten you),
 but place themselves as equal with you in contentment (modesty); truly, you should think this over.
57) Warn yourselves and be afraid that you might be gathered together and punished by people of your kind (fel-
 low human beings) when you do things that are unrightful, so that you no longer find any friend or spokes-
 person (defender) to stand by you in order that you might find clemency (grace) by admitting to your unright
 and sincerely regretting it, so that you change yourselves and become righteous (conscientious) and fair
 (responsible).
58) And those amongst you who are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones),
 do not drive out from their place those who do themselves good (learn) in the teaching of the truth, the
 teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and who are striving for the face (flawlessness) of the truth of
 the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), because as people of your
 kind (human beings), you are responsible for their wellbeing just as they are responsible for your wellbeing,
 therefore you shall not drive them out so that you do not act unfairly and do not straiten (endanger/harm) your
 own wellbeing.
59) If you are unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones), then put yourselves to
 the test as to what extent you are gracious (mild) towards yourselves and gracious (mild) towards people of
 your kind (fellow human beings), so that you may learn to appreciate in gratitude yourselves and people of
 your kind (fellow human beings) and to show them deference (esteem).
60) And if you find the way to the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation) then peace as well as truthly love will come to you, also consonance (harmony) and the freedom of
 your inner world (consciousness); and if you find the way to the real truth, then you accept yourselves in your-
 selves and show benevolence to yourselves; and if you are connected to the truth and you unknowingly do
 something evil and regret it thereafter and knowingly (consciously) abstain (liberate yourselves) from the same
 evil then you can forgive yourselves as also people of your kind (fellow human beings) forgive you.
61) And truly, the ‹Goblet of the Truth›, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the
 life makes it clear to you through all its signs (explanations) that you will find the way to the truth of the primal
 wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and that you will become one with the truth if you connect yourselves
 (make a bond) with it.
 62) The truth-teaching does not recommend for you to pray to gods and tin gods or people of your kind (human
 beings), because you shall not follow evil cravings that are concocted (hatched/invented) by people of your kind
 (human beings) so that you shall not be rightly led and go into confusion and serve fabulated (invented) gods
 and tin gods and people of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up as gods and tin gods or as their
 envoys or representatives (substitutes).
63) In all things in your life, refer to the clear evidence of the activity (existence) of the primal wellspring of all vitali-
 ties (Creation), of its laws and recommendations and of its appearance (nature), so that you may always see
 quickly what is the real truth and what is the untruth; you alone have the might to determine (decide) what is
 truth and what is untruth, because you are the assessors of this.
64) Everything that you wish to see and to experience through your determinations (decisions), that is solely in your
 might, therefore you shall decide yourselves and do rightfully so that you are not malefactors (truth-deniers)
 with regard to your determinations (decisions) and wishes.
65) The keys to what is hidden are in you yourselves, and you alone know these keys because you must open up
 your inner world (consciousness) so that you find what is hidden from you; and truly just as everything on the
 land and in the waters acts (lives) according to the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all
 vitalities (Creation), and as no leaf falls from the tree and no grain starts to grow (sprout/flourishes) in the dark-
 ness of the earth, and no stalk of grass falls prey to the drought without the action of the laws and recom-
 mendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), so also nothing prospers in you and cannot be
 torn out of the darkness of what is hidden if you do not follow your own laws and recommendations regard-
 ing the development of your inner world (consciousness).
66) And you shall always know what you do and create, both in the day and at night so that you always bring
 everything to fulfilment and you can tell people of your kind (fellow human beings) what your deeds have been
 if they want to know.
67) You, as people of your kind (human beings), are the highest life form amongst all life forms, and therefore you
 are your own intercessor (counsellor) and the guardians over yourselves, over your thoughts and feelings and
 over your doings (deeds); and therefore it remains so until death approaches you and your spirit-body (spirit-
 form) and your inner world (consciousness) escapes your body in order to escape into the impalpable (realm
 of the other world) without tarrying (quickly).
68) Truly, the spirit-body (spirit-form) returns to its own world (sphere/level) of the impalpability in order to be re-
 awakened (reincarnated/reborn) in a new body of people of your kind (human beings) at the time of neces-
 sity.
69) Truly, you alone protect yourselves and rescue yourselves from the dangers (risks) in your existence, such as on the land, on the waters, amongst the rocks (mountains), in the air, in the firmaments (universe) and on the
earths (worlds/planets) when you go out everywhere to where you want, because there are none of the fabu-
lated (invented) gods and tin gods who can vouchsafe protection for you and rescue you because whatever is
unsubstantial and delusion of the brain can neither help nor rescue nor perform miracles (outstanding things);
and consider that even if you secretly call on gods and tin gods and make supplications to them in disparaging
submissiveness, or to people of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up as godheads or as envoys
and representatives (substitutes) of gods and tin gods, then they can bring you neither help nor rescue, be-
cause they are fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods or people of your kind (human beings) and are power-
less (incapable), therefore any help and rescue in any wise is only provided by yourselves and in your power.
70) Rescue yourselves through your own power from your tribulation and from all things that bring you misery and
 disaster, because there are neither gods nor tin gods who can liberate you from it, as well as no people of your
 kind (human beings) who raise themselves up as gods or tin gods or as their envoys or representatives (substi-
 tutes), because truly, all power and all support (endeavour) lies in you yourselves.
71) And do not assume (regard) the true prophets to be gods or tin gods, or that they are their envoys or repre-
 sentatives (substitutes) who shall have might over you and sit in judgement over you so that you shall come to
 the heights (heaven) or to the underworld of the shadows (hell), because truly the prophets are neither judges
 nor executioners (enforcers), nor are there any heights (heaven) in which a godhead or a tin god carries his
 sceptre and keeps a paradise ready for you, neither an underworld of the shadows (hell) in which a devil per-
 forms his mischief and burns you (roasts you, etc.) in the fire; therefore if you believe in the heights (heaven)
 and the underworld of the shadows (hell) then you will only find both places in yourselves, in your status of
 the inner world (consciousness) and in your psyche and in your attitude (mentality); and truly, if you believe in
 the heights (heaven) and the underworld of the shadows (hell) then you are following the delusions of the false
 prophets who are giving you fallacious teachings and are lying to you so that you may split up into godlinesses
 (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults); so you are confused and through false teachings you let others feel
 acts of Gewalt and bring them through coercion to wage battle (war), to sow hatred, revenge, retaliation and
 jealousy and hostility and to bring about destruction as well as threats (terror); and guard yourselves against
 the manifold signs of distortion (deception) of the false prophets, so that you do not understand them as the
 truth, but rather recognise them as lies and slander (calumny).
 72) Therefore do not reject the truth, because only the real truth is truthliness, therefore you also comprehend
 (recognise and know) that the true prophets are not guardians over you, but are only bringers of good news
 with regard to the truth-teaching and of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitali-
 ties (Creation); and therefore they are only warners for you by pointing out (revealing) as a warning to you the
 things of the near and far time to come (future) which you must improve and therefore change (alter) to the
 good so that you are not assailed by calamity; the true prophets do not state to you good things that will occur
 in the near or far time to come (future) so that you do not act wrongly and do not make good into bad; there-
 fore the true prophets only reveal to you things of the near and far time to come (future) which are evil, bad
 and disastrous, so that you may strive to regret your wrong activities (deeds) and henceforth do everything
 rightfully so that the prophecy will not fulfil.
73) Truly, a certain time is set for every prophecy at which point it will be fulfilled when you do not do your best
 to avert the evil, the bad, the disastrous, so you or your descendants (children's children, etc.) will experience,
 that the true prophets rightfully foresee when they name things of the near and far time to come (future); and
 consider, you are not to equate a prophecy of the true prophets with a prediction that true prophets use for
 announcing to you things of the near and far time to come (future) which are sealed (unavoidable) and which
 you can do nothing to change.
74) And those amongst you who talk foolishly about the prophecies and about the prediction and the explana-
 tions of the true prophets, you bear the blame if the prophetic words of the prophets come true, because you
 mislead yourselves and people of your kind (fellow human beings) not to listen to the discerning words of the
 true prophets, so that you all together continue acting unrightfully and suggestively and forcefully bring about
 the evil, the bad, and the disastrous which the prophets proclaim (announce).
75) And those amongst you who listen to the words of those who mock the true prophets and their prophecies
 and predictions, turn yourselves away from them until they talk about something else and conduct a discus-
 sion of true discernment (rationality); and should the false prophets with their delusional teachings make you
 forget this, then do not sit together with the mockers and slanderers (calumniators) of the true prophets after
 remembering again, so that you do not find yourselves in difficulties with the truth through them.
76) Be at all times righteous ones (conscientious ones) and fair ones (responsible ones) and ever (always) bear your obligation (responsibility) so that you may take the way of the truth, of equitableness (fairness) and of virtue,
so true love may fill you and peace and freedom may grow in your inner world (consciousness), so that con-
sonance (harmony) may prevail in you and in your psyche, and you may altogether carry out all these excep-
tional (unusual) comprehensions (capabilities) in order to instruct people of your kind (fellow human beings).
77) Those amongst you who are connected to the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of
 the life, remain amongst yourselves and leave those alone who only take the teaching as a game and a pasti-
 me, and are infatuated by the earthly life; but admonish them so that they do not fall more and more victim
 to Ausartung through what they are doing which is of unright and of unfairness (irresponsibility), because
 except for you they have neither helpers nor intercessors (counsellors) unless they turn to the truth-teaching
 and take it in (learn it); and truly, if they offer you a ransom (bribe) in order to liberate them from their truth-
 unknowledge and from their inequity (unfairness), as well as from their unaccountability (irresponsibility) and
 virtuelessness, because they are of the belief that you might be able to take their blame off them and make
 them into ones knowing of the truth, then do not accept it because it would be unrightful since you do not
 have the might to satisfy their wishes and hopes; if they do not liberate themselves from their untruth and in-
 equity (unfairness) as well as unrighteousness (consciencelessness) by learning from the truth-teaching, then
 they are in themselves abandoned to ruin for their own actions of the evil and of the terrible things, so they feel
 the pain in themselves as if they had taken a gulp of boiling water and thereby inflict a painful punishment on
 themselves because they are turning away from the truth.
78) Truly, if you call upon gods and tin gods or people of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up as
 gods, none of whom are able either to benefit you or harm you, then you are taking the wrong way; there-
 fore you shall turn around on your heels (turn away from your false belief) so that you rescue yourselves from
 all evil and from everything terrible and quickly leave it behind; do not allow yourselves to be lured away from
 the truth through evil and falsehood which you call the devil so that you do not fall into confusion, but heed
 (search out) companions in the country who will call you to right leadership (guidance) and will show (reveal)
 to you the way to the teaching of the truth, to the teaching of the spirit, to the teaching of the life so that you
 may adopt the right leadership (guidance) over yourselves, as is recommended to you through the truth-teach-
 ing, as you dedicate yourselves to your own true discernment (intellect) and create in yourselves peace and love
 as well as freedom and consonance (harmony).
 79) You are recommended to be trustful in yourselves and confident that you can master from your own power
 whatever you touch (approach), because only in yourselves is all the power to act (energy) given that you
 always build up when you tackle (undertake) anything.
80) The primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is truly the sole great wisdom (Creation), it itself is the truth, the
 one which created the firmaments (universe) and earths (worlds/planets) and the heavenly lights (celestial
 bodies), and therefore it is the all-timely living one (BEING) since the days when it created everything, and it
 will remain the all-timely living one (BEING) until the day when it once again lies in slumber in order to reawaken
 (become existent once again) at its time, which is determined to it in the greatness of time (all-great-time); and
 truly, the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is solely the bearer and knower of all concealments and
 for people of your kind (human beings) it is the unmeasurable secret (the unfathomable/inscrutable), no mat-
 ter how all-knowing you may be.
81) And since only the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is the truth of all truth and is the unmeasurable
 secret (the unfathomable/inscrutable), so you are not able to make any illusions of it, as you cannot set any
 gods and tin gods next to it or people of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up over you as gods
 or tin gods; therefore, however, if you think differently and if you turn to other things, like the false teachings
 of the false prophets, then you are living in obvious confusion.
82) Raise your eyes and let your eyes wander about, over the firmaments (universe), over the heavenly lights (celes-
 tial bodies) and over your earth, so that you see what the truth of the reality is that cannot be created by people
 of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up as gods or tin gods, and neither by gods and tin gods,
 all of whom are only fantasies of invented hazy pictures (delusions); keep yourselves far away from the fabula-
 tions (inventions) of false prophets who present illusions to you that are far from the truth and reality, so that
 you may count yourselves amongst the firm ones (strong ones) in the knowledge of the truth.
83) And if the night overshadows you (if you are befallen by unknowledge) then look for a light (knowledge) which
 rises in you so that you do not founder in the darkness of the night (in unknowledge).
84) And if you see the moon rise (how knowledge is unfolding), spreading out its light (knowledge), then follow
 the light (expand the knowledge) so that it no longer sets (no longer disappears), so you are rightly led and
 are not amongst those who have gone astray.
85) And if you see the sun rise (great knowledge), spreading out its beams (wisdom), then it is the greatest thing
 that you can achieve and from which you form your unfolding (evolution), which no longer sets once you have
 created it in yourselves.
86) Truly, if you have created radiation (wisdom) and unfolding (evolution) in yourselves then you have no part
 (blame) in whatever the ones unknowing of the truth and unfair ones (irresponsible ones), the unrighteous
 ones (conscienceless ones) and virtueless ones have done of evil and of terribleness of all kinds, just as you also
 have no part (blame) if they place fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods next to the primal wellspring of all
 vitalities (Creation), or people of your kind (human beings) who raise themselves up as gods or tin gods or their
 envoys or representatives (substitutes).
87) Look and turn your face to the truth, to the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) which alone is the truth
 of all truth and alone the greatness of wisdom (Creation), because it is the sole might over everything that
 exists in the firmaments (universe) and on the earths (worlds/planets) as well as in the lights of the sky (firma-
 ment); therefore you may recognise (see) this truth and be upright in your knowledge of it, so that you rely
 solely upon the truth and do not place any gods or tin gods next to the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation), and also no people of your kind (human beings), because all of these are powerless (incapable) and
 cannot bring forth (create) any life.
88) And whether you are a clan (family), people who live nearby (neighbours), friends, companions, followers (ac -
 quaintances) or a people or several peoples, then do not fight with one another but be fair amongst one an-
 other and lead yourselves fairly so that love and peace be amongst all, as well as freedom and consonance
 (harmony), so that you are rightly led.
89) And do not fear those who wish to sow ill blood, discord and strife amongst you, rather stand at their side
 with good words and instruct (teach) them in peace, in equitableness (fairness) and in righteousness (conscien-
 tiousness) and in all things of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitali -
 ties (Creation), so that they may follow the right way and refrain from their terrible doings; but be peaceful to
 them and do not foment hatred and unlove or revenge and retaliation in yourselves against them, because they
 are people of your kind (human beings) and require instruction and good leadership (guidance).
90) Therefore you shall not fear those either who set gods and tin gods or people of your kind (human beings)
 next to the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), who believe themselves to be gods, because you have
 the authority to instruct them through the truth so that they may become thinking and knowing in the truth,
 and may find their right and their safety in the truth.
 91) And if they become knowing (conscious) in the truth and in equitableness (fairness) and they do not mix these
 up with untruths and inequity (unfairness), then they will find their peace and be rightly led; and truly, the evi-
 dence for this will be given to them when they raise themselves up to the weight (the level) of ones knowing
 of the truth and become wise.
92) The laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) are given to you so that you
 may recognise and follow them and be led rightly in your existence, so that you may be creators of good things
 and also instruct (teach) your descendants, so that also your offspring (children's children, etc.) may be fair ones
 (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones), supporters of the truth, of equitableness (fairness)
 and of virtues.
93) And all in the group of the few before you who were fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (consci-
 entious ones), as well as ones knowing of the truth, they were led (guided) by the ‹Goblet of the Truth› which
 is the teaching of the prophets, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life as
 is given through the truthliness of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation); therefore you are recommended to do the same as the group of the few before you who were your
 forefathers and foremothers and from whose lines you proceeded as their descendants (children's children,
 etc.).
94) And truly, those in the group of the few before you who were fair ones (responsible ones), righteous ones
 (conscientious ones) and ones knowing of the truth, they were all talented amongst people of your kind
 (human beings) through their own efforts and they followed the truth as also they awakened (encouraged)
 their brothers and sisters and their children and friends to the truth so that they led (guided) themselves on the
 right way.
95) Truly, that is the leadership (guidance) of the truth itself, so that all who turn to it take the right way out of
 themselves and do not pray to gods and tin gods and not to people of your kind (human beings) because doing
 this is an ineffective activity (fruitless/without success).
96) And truly, these few before you were the ones who comprehended (recognised) the teaching of the prophets
 as truth, and followed it and also protected the true prophethood; but those amongst you who, as far de-
 scendants (children's children, etc.), have seized the dominance over all evil and inequity (unfairness) as well
 as over unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and virtuelessness, you show those before you ingratitude for
 what they have done for you, and therefore you only show ingratitude for what the prophets do for you who
 trustingly give you the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life.
97) There are only few amongst you who are rightly led (guided) by the teaching of the prophets; and the true
 prophets who do not demand any payment from you for their care (favour/effort), not only do they teach you
 in modesty the teaching of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation),
 but they teach it as an admonishment and sign-posting for all the mass of all people of your kind (humankind);
 and truly, the teaching of the prophets is no discipline (coercion) and does not bear in itself any Gewalt (ter-
 ror), because heeding of (following of/integrating with) the teaching is given as unbiddenness (free will) so that
 everyone may decide for himself or herself whether he or she wants to integrate with it or not.
98) Truly, those amongst you, you do not appraise the truth and the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life correctly if you think that it reveals nothing to you that you do not already know,
 because truly, you are inexperienced (unknowing) in the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring
 of all vitalities (Creation) and in the laws and recommendations of its appearance (nature), therefore a light
 (instruction) has to be set for you and a leadership (guidance) has to be given through the true prophets so
 that you become rightful in your thoughts and feelings and in your inner world (consciousness) and follow the
 way of the truth; and consider whether you treat the teaching of the prophets like a shred of cheap fabric
 (material/cloth) or whether you accept it as a valueful treasure, in this wise you show through your behaviour
 which attitude (mentality) you are the child of; truly, even if you attempt to conceal your attitude (mentality)
 then it can be seen (read) in your face, so you therefore cannot conceal (hide) what your attitude (mentality)
 is, so you earn yourselves honour or defilement from people of your kind (fellow human beings) depending on
 what your face reveals.
99) Truly, if you want to reveal yourselves in defilement then continue to enjoy your wrong doings and continue
 your vain and foolish prattle which marks (stamps) you as idiots (fools) until you finally allow true discernment
 (intellect) to come forth in you when you overcome your unintellect (dumbness) in yourselves and you deliber-
 ately (consciously) turn to the truth and the truth-teaching.
100) And truly, what is being announced to you through the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life and is being revealed to you through the true prophets is full of boon (prosperousness) and
of what you shall follow and fulfil (master) through the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of
all vitalities (Creation); and therefore it is the teaching of the warning so that you shall not do things that are
unrightful and not do things of lovelessness, virtuelessness and unrighteousness (consciencelessness), as you
shall not perform bloody deeds (murder and manslaughter), not wage battles (wars) and not destroy the works
(achievements) of people of your kind (human beings), just as you shall not give yourselves over to unpeace and unfreedom (bondage), dissonance (disharmony) and jealousy, nor hatred, persecution, strife or the patho- logical craving for revenge and pathological craving for retaliation.
101) If you fabulate (invent) lies against the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) or claim that the teaching of
 the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life has become obvious (recognisable) to you and claim
 that you have understood it although this does not correspond to the truth, then you are not only unfair ones
 (irresponsible ones) and liars, but also slanderers (calumniators); and if you commit such inequity (unfairness)
 and spread lies and slanders (calumnies) then you are malefactors (doers of misdeeds) and slanderers against
 the truth which you see in the maws (jaws) of death (unknowledge of the truth) from which hands are out-
 stretched attempting to drag you into depravity; and truly if you allow yourselves to be dragged into the de-
 pravity of unknowledgeness of the truth then your reward is defilement because you say false things against
 the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and slander the truth, there-
 fore you are turning yourselves away from the signs (evidence) of the truth with disdain.
102) Those amongst you who commit outrages against the truth, you are probably looking for the real truth, one
 after the other just as you move (bestir) yourselves to this, but you are not looking to the truth itself but to
 gods and tin gods and their servants (hands/helpers) as is erroneously taught to you by the false prophets of
 the untruth through godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults); truly, you who are looking for the
 real truth and nevertheless are following the fallacious teachings of false prophets, you can only find the truth
 if you have intercessors (counsellors) for you and you leave the false teachings behind yourselves; but by doing
 so do not assume (believe) that your intercessors (counsellors) for finding the real truth are intercessors (coun-
 sellors) of a god or tin god, because if they were such then they would continue to ensnare you in inequity
 (unfairness) and lie, in slander (calumny) and in unaccountability as well as in all things of unright; truly, inter-
 cessors (advisers) of the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life do not pro-
 claim to you lies and slanders (calumnies) of the truth by binding (linking) you to gods and tin gods, rather they
 teach you the real truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation);
 if you do not listen to the intercessors (counsellors) of the true truth-teaching then you will be cut off from the
 laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), so everything will disappear from
 you which you assume (believe) to receive through the truth.
103) Truly, only the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) allow the seeds to
 germinate that you put (sow) into the earth so that the living in it may come forth, which you imagine (con-
 sider) to be dead but is only sleeping and has life within it which however thrives again and grows up to a new
 aliveness through moisture (wetness/water), therefore new life comes forth out of the apparent lifeless; learn
 from this that you also are a seed, so to speak, which is reawakened (rebirth of the spirit-form) after death
 through the spirit-body (spirit-form); truly, be connected to this teaching and do not let yourselves be turned
 away (restrained) from it for the sake of false teachings by false prophets.
104) Let the day break in you (start the search for the truth) so that you may escape from the rest (semi-con-
 sciousness) of the night (unknowledgenesss of the truth) and the weak light (searching) of the moon (semi-
 consciousness), in order to show your deference to the sun (wisdom) so that you may make your studies of the
 teaching and take the necessary time for this.
105) And truly, the lights (celestial bodies) in the firmament are also created for you that you are able to maintain the right direction with their help in the day and in the night when you are going across the land and travel-
ling over the waters (seas) or flying through the airs if this will be possible for you; truly, these signs (evidence)
are presented down to the last detail for people of your kind (human beings) who have the knowledge of this.
106) And as you have proceeded from the earth through its sequence (process) of unfolding (development) from
 animated (organic) acidic waters (amino acids) and from the minutest creatures (microorganisms) and you have
 unfolded (developed) into people of your kind (human beings), so Earth is also given to you in order for you
 to have a dwelling and a place to stay on it until you raise yourselves into the airs and search for new earths
 (worlds/planets) in the firmaments (universe) as new homesteads; and truly, these signs (evidence) are pre-
 sented down to the last detail for people of you kind (human beings), if you want to understand it, if you open
 your ears and are connected to your true discernment (intellect) by taking the teaching of the prophets as the
 real truth.
107) And truly, the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) decide (determine) everything according to its value, therefore also that you unfold (evolve) yourselves in the striving for knowl-
edge and wisdom, so that you will one day explore (control) the appearance (nature) and make the waters (rain)
fall from the clouds according to your will and all growth to be brought forth (formed) according to your wish
(will); therefore, everything will blossom and thrive according to your will, and you will make rowed corn (cere-
als) and many other things sprout according to your consideration (discretion) when you change it in its nature
(gene manipulation); therefore you will bring forth (create) growth (plants) of which you yourselves are the
creators, which however can only prosper through the laws of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation);
and through your unfolding (evolution) you bring forth gardens in which many growths (plants) prosper, which are similar or unsimilar to one another, so that you have a wide variety of provision (food) from all parts of the world; truly these are signs (evidence) for all those amongst you who understand the truth.
108) But as you transform (manipulate the genes of) growths (plants) in their growing and their yield, as well as
 transforming (manipulating the genes of) animals and other creatures and you modify (breed) them, then you
 cannot raise yourselves up as gods and tin gods or place yourselves at the side of the primal wellspring of all
 vitalities (Creation), because it alone is given the might to create out of itself created creations (creatures/cre-
 ations/life forms) of all species and forms; people of your kind (human beings), however, are created creations
 (creations) of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), therefore you are integrated into its laws and
 recommendations, so you can only bring forth (create) new created creations (creatures/creations/life forms)
 and growths (plants) through transformation (gene manipulation) and change (breeding) as is permitted to you
 through the laws of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation).
109) Do not be presumptuous and do not regard yourselves as rivals of the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation), because no matter how knowing (conscious) and wise you may be, you as people of your kind
 (human beings) can never be equal to it; through its laws and recommendations, you have come forth from
 the earth as people of your kind (human beings); but do not impute to the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation) any sons or any daughters in your unknowledge, because it is sublime (superior) over having other
 mights next to itself, except itself.
110) The primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is the sole and unaccompanied creator of all firmaments (uni-
 verse) and earths (worlds/planets) and lights (celestial bodies) in the firmament, and therefore of all vitalities
 (life forms/existence), therefore how should it have sons and daughters as it has no companion and created
 everything alone and is knowing (conscious) of all things?
111) And truly, the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) is the sole might of all presence (existence) in the fir-
 maments (universe) of all earths (worlds/planets) and lights (celestial bodies) in the firmament, as well as of all
 things over which it is the guardian.
112) The eyesight of people of your kind (human beings) cannot reach the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation) in its value (power) of its invisible spirit-body (invisible spirituality/spirit-energy), but you can see its
 creation in the appearance (nature) and in the firmaments (universe) as well as on the earths (worlds/planets)
 and in the lights (celestial bodies) of the firmament, therefore it, which is uncomprehensible to you, reaches
 you with its fullness.
113) Through the firmaments (universe) and through the earths (worlds/planets), and also through the appearance
 (nature), through all created creations (life forms) and all things, you are given visible evidence of the presence
 (existence) of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation); and whoever amongst you sees and comprehends
 (recognises) them, it is to their own benefit; but whoever is blind (does not see, i.e. recognise the evidence)
 this is to their own disadvantage because they do not recognise themselves as guardians over what has been
 given to them through the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and has been entrusted for protection
 and preservation.
114) If you heed all the manifold signs (unsurpassabilities) in the appearance (nature), then you will comprehend
 (recognise) the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) so that you will
 learn to interpret them and to make them clear to yourselves of what importance they are for people of your
 kind (human beings) and for the existence, so that you may know about the real truth and no longer go into
 confusion.
115) Follow what is revealed to you by the signs (unsurpassabilities) of the appearance (nature) so you comprehend
 (recognise) that there are no gods or tin gods and no people of your kind (human beings) who could accom-
 plish such miracles (outstanding things) as the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) does and presents
 (gives) to you as a gift of love; therefore turn yourselves away from gods and tin gods and people of your kind
 who raise themselves up as gods or servants of gods or servants of tin gods and lead you into the delusion and
 servitude (bondage) of godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults).
116) Servants of gods and servants of tin gods compel your power to act (will) so that you fall prey to a belief
 (assumptions) in gods or tin gods and place these gods and tin gods at the side of the primal wellspring of all
 vitalities (Creation); but heed the truth that you shall be guardians of the real truth and watchers thereover
 that the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life keeps out all untruth and in-
 equity (unfairness), all unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and dissonance (disharmony) from the world so
 that true love and peace shall prevail amongst all you people of your kind (humankind), as well as freedom and
 consonance (harmony), so that all hatred, all jealousy and all strife, all outrage (torture/Gewalt/coercion), all
 bloody deeds (murder in any form), all battles (war) and all pathological craving for revenge and pathological
 craving for retaliation may also disappear (vanish), just like destruction, lying, deceit, slander (calumny), mis-
 deeds and defilement (crime)
117) And do not vilify (humiliate) those who call on (search for) the truth and fight against it in doing so without knowledge (unknowingly) because they do not know how to come in contact with it on the right way and
therefore do wrong things; therefore you shall be guides and intercessors (counsellors) to them so that they appear pleased towards the truth, find the right way and understand the truth-teaching and all its things; and if you do this then they will proclaim to you the prosperousness (success) of their learning and they will be thankful to you and announce to you what efforts they have made.
118) Do not swear a solemn oath on yourselves or on gods or tin gods that signs (evidence) should come to you
 which are favourable (pleasing) for you and which you want to believe in if they would appear to you, because
 truly if you do this then you are swearing an oath against the truth because you cannot understand it; true
 signs (evidence) are only with the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and with its appearance (nature),
 as well as with the true prophets who bring you the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal well-
 spring of all vitalities (Creation).
119) And do not confuse your inner world (consciousness) and your eyes through false signs (false evidence) from
 false prophets who want to convert (proselytise) you to their fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods through
 lying and deceptive pictures (delusions of the brain), as their priests and servants of gods and servants of tin
 gods also do.
120) And be certain (knowing) that neither gods nor tin gods – because after all they all are only fabulations (inven-
 tions) of people of your kind (human beings) – send down to you rescuing liberators (angels) in order to bring
 you salvation (redemption) from your missteps (blame/unvirtues/offences) and vices and in order to wake the
 dead, because truly these are only lying words of enticement, without content of reality, which are only in-
 tended to make you fall prey to the belief (assumptions) in the hazy pictures (fantasies) which are presented
 to you as an illusion.
121) Therefore you cannot meet any liberator (angel) who saves you face-to-face, rather you can only see images
 of the delusions of the inner world (consciousness) if you go astray in it (have delusions), but this happens to
 you through the unknowledgeness of the truth because you devote yourselves to the belief (assumptions) in
 fabulated (invented) gods and tin gods, and because you also believe in their fabulated (invented) rescuing lib-
 erators (angels) and demons.
122) Truly, as you believe in gods and demons as well as in liberators (angels) and venerable ones (holy ones) and
 in the evil of your kind (personified devil), then you do this in unknowledgeness of the real truth of the true
 presence (existence) of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) which in its consonance (harmony) and
 neutrality creates neither good nor evil, therefore such doings are solely in the might and in the reflection and
 striving of people of your kind (human beings), as you perform it (carry out) according to your free will.
123) And truly, as those amongst you who have your free will and act according to it, so you create in your rows,
 according to free will, a picture of enmity against the true prophets as well, thus you are the personified dev-
 ilishness against them; and you make flaunting (pretentious) speeches against them amongst people of your
 kind (fellow human beings) which are lies and deception and slander (calumny), and you act as if the true
 prophets were wanting to influence your will through coercion with the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the
 spirit, the teaching of the life, so you truly go forth in your fabulated (invented) lies and slanders (calumnies)
 and sow lies and unpeace against them.
124) And so that those amongst you, who do not open their ears to your words of lying and slander (calumny), shall
 fall in bondage to your words, you fabulate (invent) all kinds of false signs (false evidence) so that the ones to
 whom you are lying shall find pleasure in this, so that you can gain (rob) from them all that they acquire (earn)
 such as gold and possessions.
125) But truly, if you are amongst those who are evildoers and unfair ones and are connected to those who deceive
 the fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones (conscientious ones), then you will find no other judges
 than those who administer punishment to you in a fair (responsible) wise, so they lead you to places of fulfil-
 ment of guidelines (secluded places/isolated islands) where you shall stay for a time during which you turn
 yourselves away from unfair (irresponsible) and unrighteous (conscienceless) things.
126) Do not be doubters in these things, because it is the truth, but if you doubt it and do unfair things (irrespon-
 sible things) and unrighteous things (conscienceless things) and evil, so you will have to carry this burden
 because you will be called to account.
127) The laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) are fulfilled in truth and equi-
 tableness (fairness), and as people of your kind (human beings) you cannot change one speck of dust of a weight
 of them.
128) And if you follow the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), then you
 are knowing ones and wise ones; those of you, however, who follow the majority of those who are on Earth
 and are dismissive of the laws and recommendations, they are leading (guiding) themselves into delusion and
 are going forth on the wrong way, following a hazy picture (delusion) and lying against the truth and slander -
 ing (calumniating) it.
 129) Truly, when you are of open sense, then you will very well recognise those who are not treading the right way
 of the truth and are straying from one terrible thing to the next and from one inequity (unfairness) to another,
 and are keeping themselves at arm's length from the rightly led ones.
130) And when you are eating and drinking, consider that everything is given to you because everything only pros-
 pers and grows through the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), and
 that your existence also is integrated in this and you only breathe because it is regulated (determined) through
 the primal (creative) rights of the laws (principles).
131) And truly, you have no reason not to eat and drink of everything that is given to you through the appearance
 (nature) of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), excepting that which is inedible and poisonous to
 you; and therefore do not allow food and drink to be banned to you through coercion by worshippers of gods
 and worshippers of tin gods, and neither by priests and false prophets and the like, if it tastes good to you and
 serves for your provision (food); and truly, there are very many amongst you who pray to gods and tin gods
 and lie that you are not allowed to eat and drink of this and that because it is unclean, but do not open your
 ears to them because they are only lying and wallowing in their evil cravings of their might over you, and there-
 fore they are wallowing in their lies through a lack of knowledge with regard to the truth of the laws and
 recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) by making themselves guilty of infringe-
 ment of the laws of the primal power (Creation).
132) And do not eat and drink and acquire anything that has been stolen and is offered to you, because truly it is
 unrightful to do so; also, do not buy anything that is stolen in order to offer it to others again in return for
 gain (dealing in stolen goods), because this is also unrightful; therefore do not allow yourselves to be ensnared
 in deeds of unright when false friends tell you to do so; and therefore do not fight with them regarding stolen
 goods either, but keep yourselves away both from the unright goods and from the false friends, because if you
 listen to them then you will fall into unright and do unrightful deeds, and your reward will be shameful.
133) And avoid obvious infamous actions (crimes) and outrages (deeds of Gewalt) as well as clandestine ones,
 because truly whoever commits infamous actions (crimes) and outrages (actions of Gewalt) will receive a poor
 reward for it.
134) And do not lend your ear to practitioners of suggestive spells and acts (magicians) who lie that they could
 return to life what is dead through the activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic), because truly
 suggestive trickery (magic) and activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic) are merely delusion and
 pretence (deception) against you if you consider it to be the truth, because whatever is dead cannot be brought
 back to life again; therefore none are able to walk amongst you who were dead; but whoever insists on
 (claims) something different is one who is chained in the blackest darkness of the lie and is unable to come
 forth from it (unable to liberate oneself); truly, whatever they do in terms of suggestive trickery (magic) and
 activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic) and whatever they say about it is lies and deception and
 only serves them to appear pleasant towards you (to enjoy a high standing).
135) Truly, there is neither suggestive trickery (magic) nor activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic),
 because all this is merely lying and deception and acts of trickery (legerdemain), like everything that requires
 suggestive sayings (magic formulas).
136) Wherever you may go, over land, in any place and in any town, everywhere you will find impostors who boast
 of suggestive trickery (magic) and of activities of the shadow world (activities of hell/magic), but do not open your
 ears to them because everything is merely an illusion of the insubstantial and hallucinations (delusional con-
 structions) in order to exploit you and to make you believe that inexplicable (supernatural) things exist which
 might bring you harm if you are not connected to the practitioners of suggestive spells and acts (magicians)
 and do not give them a high payment.
137) Do not allow yourselves to be deceived by practitioners of suggestive spells and acts (magicians) so that you
 do not live in total darkness in your thoughts and feelings and in your inner world (consciousness) and forge
 intrigues (guilefulness) yourselves in order to deceive others through suggestive trickery (magic); truly, if you do
 such things then you are merely forging intrigues (guilefulness) against yourselves, which you do not notice
 however because you are caught in yourselves through forging your own intrigues (guilefulness).
138) Truly, only the truth is the smith of all irrefutability (rightness/reality/flawlessness/realness/truthfulness), and if
 you receive a sign (evidence of the truth) of the real truth, then open yourselves to it and comprehend (recog-
 nise) what realities you are receiving so that you may know what you must begin with the truth, so you can pass
 on the message of truth to people of your kind (the next ones); but if people of your kind (human beings) do
 not want to accept your message then do not allow yourselves to be suppressed by them, and therefore show
 no submissiveness if they forge intrigues (guilefulness) against you.
139) You shall be strong and guide (lead) yourselves so that you broaden (open) your breast (feelings) for the teach- ing of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life, so that you accept the truth and do not fall
into delusion, because if you make your breast (feelings) narrow (you close your feelings) for the truth, then
you cannot rise into the insight (firmament/height) of all cognition (wisdom), because you impose affliction (danger) on yourselves and are unknowing ones in the truth.
140) Consider that the real truth is the way of the life, the straight way which is right; and only the truth presents
 to you the signs (evidence) of its reality so that you can consider (heed) them.
141) In yourselves is the dwelling of peace, of love and of freedom as well as of consonance (harmony) determined
 in all truth, so that you make all of these high values to your united (confidential) friend, with which you deter-
 mine your deeds.
142) Truly, if you gather as righteous ones (conscientious ones) and fair ones (responsible ones) with people of your
 kind (fellow human beings) then search out those amongst you who are not dependent on infamous actions
 (crimes), inequity (unfairness) and unaccountability (consciencelessness), rather search out people of your kind
 (fellow human beings) as friends so that you may enjoy advantages (benefits) from one another in uprightness
 and dignity, and determine a lasting friendship at the end of the period of gathering.
143) Your dwelling place shall not be the fire of a shadow world (hell) in yourselves, but instead a garden of joy and love, of peace, of freedom and consonance (harmony), and you shall stay in it and be full of happiness.
144) Never place malefactors (doers of Gewalt) and shameful ones and other unrighteous ones (conscienceless
 ones) and unfair ones (irresponsible ones) above yourselves in order to lead (guide) you, rather be your own
 leaders (guides) in righteousness (conscientiousness), in equitableness (fairness) and dignity in order that it may
 go well with you.
145) Truly, the true prophets have come to you since time immemorial, come forth from your midst, to teach you
 the signs (evidence) of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities
 (Creation) and proclaim to you and warn you of the unrightful doings you shall not do so that you will not be
 brought to account one day for misdeeds and outrages (acts of Gewalt) and so that you allow love to awaken
 in you, creating freedom and peace and consonance (harmony) in you and connecting you to equitableness
 (fairness) and righteousness (conscientiousness).
146) Do not bear witness in unright against yourselves, so you do not deceive your life on Earth, and neither give
 false testimony (false oath) against the real truth and do not become unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and
 unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) so that you do not have to be ashamed of yourselves.
147) Do not harbour enmity against yourselves, and also not against others who have different skin colours and
 languages as well as different customs from you, or who have fallen prey to a belief (assumptions) in gods or
 tin gods, and therefore do not wage battle (war) against them either, so you do not destroy their cities and
 hamlets (villages) or kill (murder) people of your kind (fellow human beings); and this shall be so irrespective
 of whether you warn or threaten the inhabitants of the towns in advance, because it is not rightful to harbour
 enmity against people of your kind (human beings) to wage battle (war) and to wreak destruction.
148) Heed yourselves to be fair ones (responsible ones), so that you are not out to condemn others for any sort of
 reasons that may be convenient for you, do not cause them harm or kill them in order to rob their possessions
 or destroy them; consider that all people of your kind (human beings) are on different steps (levels) of unfolding
 (evolution), so that some are further along than others and some are believers in gods and tin gods, in libera-
 tors (angels) and demons, whereas others are connected to the real truth; and therefore you cannot assess
 people of your kind (human beings) according to these things with regard to their being of your kind (being
 equal to you); and truly, you are all different from one another according to your doings, therefore you cannot
 oversee (assess) all people of your kind (human kind), but only one or another as you cannot consider (assess)
 an entire people according to the deeds of an individual or a collective (group).
149) Truly, you are the master over yourselves in all things, so you are self-sufficient ones and create for yourselves
 benevolence or malevolence; if you want, you can take away everything from yourselves that is of love, of
 peace, of freedom and of consonance (harmony), or on the other hand you can allow true love and freedom
 and consonance (harmony) as well as true peace to prosper in the place of your inner nature according to your
 preference; and therefore you can do the same for your descendants if you instruct (teach) them in one or
 another wise.
150) Truly, what you promise yourselves will happen for you, and you cannot thwart (prevent) it because your power
 to act (will) is your kingdom of heaven.
151) Act both alone (individually) and together as a people according to good ability with regard to the laws and
 recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) so that others will not act against you ac -
 cording to bad ability, therefore consider that your final reward will always be in accordance with how you
 acted in good or bad ability; therefore it will go well for the fair ones (responsible ones) and righteous ones
 (conscientious ones), and it will go badly for the unfair ones (irresponsible ones) and unrighteous ones (con-
 scienceless ones) because they will be called to account in punishment.
 152) And do not allow fruits of the field to grow and livestock to be raised (bred) in order to be misused as sacrifi-
 cial offerings to gods or tin gods because you fallaciously believe that it would bring you advantage (benefit)
 or placate the gods and tin gods; but truly, neither your prayers (invocations/edifications) nor your supplica-
 tions, nor your offerings (sacrifices) reach the gods and tin gods because these are mere unsubstantial figures
 of delusion (illusions) which can neither bring you goodness nor evil; consider that only the primal wellspring
 of all vitalities (Creation) with its laws and recommendations and its appearance (nature) is truth and reality,
 therefore you are making a terrible decision (conclusion) if you believe in gods and tin gods.
153) Truly, since long before you (time immemorial), you have been led astray by the false teachings of false prophets
 and by priests and all kinds of servants (hands/helpers) who pray to gods and tin gods and bring down calami-
 ties upon you; therefore, many of the priests, of the servants of gods and servants of tin gods have made the
 killing of your children and also of people of your kind (adults) appear as pleasing to you so that you become
 depraved and your belief in the gods and tin gods confuses you; and they do it so that you may be debased
 (made dependent) and subjugated (placed in bondage) by the false prophets and priests as well as by the
 leaders of the godlinesses (religions) and sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) and exploited by them; and they rob you
 of your goods and chattels as well as of your riches, at the same time as also outraging (committing torture
 and murder) on your blood, body and life and fulfilling (gratifying) their ausgeartet libidinous lustfulness (sex-
 ual Ausartung) on you and on your children in secret; and they lie that all these terrible things are pleasing to
 their gods and tin gods so that they can coerce everything from you and from your children that they want;
 and if their nefarious activity (villainy) is openly (publicly) cried out (known) amongst you then they deny it or
 fabulate (allege) that you and your children wanted it; truly, it is particularly heinous (villainous) to defile (sex-
 ually misuse) children through libidinous lustfulness, therefore everyone, man and woman, shall be brought to
 account for this through severe punishment.
154) And the false prophets and servants of gods and servants of tin gods lie to you that one or another domesti-
 cated animal or game animal as well as other creatures, fruits of the forest, fruits of the water, garden fruits
 and fruits of the field are forbidden to you so that you should not eat and drink of them, but truly everything
 is allowed to you for your provision (food) which is edible and drinkable for you and is good, if you do not take
 any harm from it; such forbidding, as is taught to you by the false prophets, priests, servants of gods and ser-
 vants of tin gods, is in truth only a lie and fabulated (invented) machinations in order to lead you astray and
 to strike you down into servitude (bondage) of belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods.
155) And do not be foolish and do not open your true discernment (intellect) to the lies of the false prophets, to
 the priests, the servants of gods and servants of tin gods who deceive you and say that what is flesh of this or
 another animal and of this or another creature shall be exclusively reserved for the man and forbidden for the
 woman, or that it is exclusively reserved for the woman and forbidden for the man; truly, such assertions are
 lies against the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and
 of its appearance (nature), because all things that prosper, grow and live through the appearance (nature), so
 also all animals and other creatures and all the things that belong to them are equally given for the woman
 and for the man so that equitableness (fairness) shall prevail in all things for people of your kind (human
 beings) of both kinds (gender).
156) Truly, it is heinous (villainous) to kill children, whether out of unknowledgeness, out of jealousy or revenge, out
 of hatred or rage, in strife or on any grounds whatsoever, because the laws and recommendations of the primal
 wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) do not allow the killing of children, and neither the killing of those who
 have grown out of youth (grown up), except if it is in defence in extremis (self-defence) and no other possibility
 of defence (self-defence) is given; therefore you shall not overstep the bounds (limits) of defence in extremis
 (self-defence) and you shall not bring it about intentionally (consciously), so that you will not be called to
 account (punished).
157) And domesticated animals have come forth for you from the appearance (nature) through the laws and recom-
 mendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), created in pairs, male and female, such as sheep
 and goats, horses and camels, and therefore also cattle, cats and dogs and poultry of various forms, so that
 they may be useful for you in work and as protection, as well as that you may feed yourselves from them; and
 nothing is forbidden to you as your provision (food) therefore you shall not lend your ears to the lies that
 people of your kind (human beings) concoct (hatch) against the truth namely that you shall not eat from this
 and that, because consider that those who are lying to you are without knowledge and merely want to lead
 you into confusion, both you alone and all people.
158) You will find nothing in what is obvious (recognisable) to you through the truth that is forbidden as food and drink, except for animals that are sick and perished or spilled blood which is unclean (slimy/bad) and no longer
edible; and no flesh, no blood and no lard (fat) of any animals and other creatures is truly unclean (slimy/bad)
unless it is dangerous for you because of noxiousness (toxicity); therefore it is permitted to you to eat all the
flesh and all the blood and all lard (fat) of domesticated animals, poultry and game without exception so that
you do not have to starve for want of provision (food); and you are permitted to eat all creatures and all animals
as your provision (food) which have claws and shoes (hooves) on their feet, toes, claws and skin, and there-
fore you are allowed everything that crawls and flies and search out all innoxious things (non-toxic things) as drink and wine and other fermented juices providing you enjoy it in right measure, so that you do not fall prey to drunkenness.
159) And if the unfair ones (irresponsible ones), the unrighteous ones (conscienceless ones) and believers in gods
 and believers in tin gods accuse (denounce) you of lying, that, on the contrary, you are not allowed to eat and
 drink of this and that, then tell them that it is a complete lie and that those turn away rigourously from the truth,
 who are lying in such a wise and are leading you and the entire people astray and wanting to make you guilty
 against the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation).
160) And consider those who want to lead you into confusion and who place gods and tin gods at the side of the
 primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), they are committing their defilement in vain because the wisdom
 of all wisdom (Creation) cannot have any gods and tin gods placed next to it, neither any people of your kind
 (human beings) who raise themselves up as gods or tin gods, because it is itself the highest heightening (sub-
 limity) above everything else in its all-embracing wisdom; therefore not even your fore-forefathers and fore-fore-
 mothers (fore-forebears/forebears before them) and your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears)
 could place any gods or tin gods or any people of your kind (human beings) next to the primal wellspring of
 all vitalities (Creation), just as you cannot either, because in your lowliness you are by no means of its kind, there-
 fore you cannot illicitly place gods and tin gods or people of your kind (human beings) next to it; however, if
 you dare in the presumptuousness of a belief (assumptions) in gods and tin gods and people of your kind
 (human beings) to place these at the side of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) by praying to your
 gods and tin gods and people of your kind (human beings) instead of being connected to it, then you are
 deceiving yourselves and committing an outrage against the truth.
161) And if you commit an outrage against the truth, then you are doing the same as those before you did, because
 truly, if you do the same as your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears) did, then you also curse the
 true prophets and accuse them of falseness (deviousness) so they get to taste your strictness and inequity
 (unfairness); and if you do such things then you truly do not have any truthly knowledge that could come forth
 in you, because you are only following a deception (delusion) and are merely lying.
162) And the convincing evidence that you are behaving in this way is given in that you blame the true prophets of
 lying and slander (calumny) and attempt to kill them so that they shall be silent and shall not announce the
 truth; and if it were down to your strivings then you would force them to say what you want to hear and to
 act only according to your convenience (will); but the true prophets do not allow themselves to be threatened
 (frightened) through your embitterment (tormenting), but continue to strive to lead (guide) you rightly.
163) And if you slander (calumniate) the true prophets and accuse them of unhonesty and false teaching, and claim
 that their teaching of the truth, their teaching of the spirit, their teaching of the life is forbidden through the
 primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), then provide evidence and witnesses for this, but you cannot do
 this because if you bring forth evidence against the truth then it is full of lies, since there is no evidence against
 the truth; and if you bring witnesses against the truth, then they are making a false testimony (false oath)
 against the truth and thereby bear witness themselves that they are speaking a false testimony (false oath) and
 only following the cravings of those who are lying against the signs (evidence) of the truth and believe it to be
 machinations of unfairness (irresponsibility), because they equate the real truth with evil in their limitedness
 (unintellect).
164) But listen to what the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation)
 teaches and what is to be presented to you so that you may understand what is rightful and what is unright-
 ful; you shall not place anything at the side of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), and you shall
 also honour your parents and do good things to them; and you shall not kill your children, not out of poverty,
 not in strife, not out of jealousy, not out of revenge and retaliation, not because you are waging battles (wars),
 and not either because you would prefer to have sons rather than daughters or would prefer to have daughters
 rather than sons, also not from any reasons whatever they may be, rather look after them rightfully as you also
 look after yourselves; and you shall not approach the terrible (do nothing terrible) whether it is open (public)
 or concealed; and you shall not either kill any other life of people of your kind (human beings), because life is
 made through the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) such that it shall be inviolable by people of your
 kind (human beings) except through the right, when demanded by defence in extremis (self-defence) because
 you must protect your life; and killing people of your kind (human beings) is not permitted to you either through
 battle (war) or through a judgement of the authority or the jurisdiction, or through a kangaroo court (revenge)
 or through a law of honour created by people of your kind (human beings), because such killing is Ausartung
 against all laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation); this is what is recom-
 mended to you so that you may understand it.
165) And do not approach the possessions of orphans (do not appropriate for yourselves the possessions of or - phans) except if you are using the possessions for the best outcome of the orphans until they have grown out
of youth (come of age) and can themselves determine (decide) over the possessions; and if you sell anything then
give full measure and weight in equitableness (approval/fairness); and do not impose on people of your kind (fellow human beings) more (do not demand more) than they are able to bear (pay), and this shall apply in com- merce as well as in true discernment (intellect) and with regard to admonishment (conscience); and when you make a judgement then practise equitableness (fairness) so that no-one is advantaged and no-one disadvan- taged, even if it is someone from your own clan (family), from your relatives or from your friends; and you shall always retain the bond (agreement) with the truth so that you may always be admonished and may take the right way.
166) Learn everything of the teaching of the true prophets and go forth and announce that this is the true way, the
 straight one, the right one; follow this way and not the other paths so that you are not led far astray by them
 into the darkness of inequity (unfairness) and unknowledgeness of the truth; this is what is recommended to
 you through the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) so that you
 enable yourselves to protect yourselves from evil.
167) And again: You receive the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life through
 the true prophets so that you may fulfil it and gain goodness for yourselves when you do good deeds; learn
 from the teaching of the prophets about the clarity of all things and form from it the leadership (guidance) for
 your life, so that you may always recognise the truth in all things and at all times, whether you meet it by day
 or in the night.
168) And truly, the teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life is full of boon (prosper-
 ousness) and fullness (gain), when you strive to follow it and you guard yourselves against doing things that
 are evil, unfair (irresponsible), unrighteous (conscienceless) and unrightful; and if you follow the truth then you
 are creating benevolence for yourselves, and therefore you find in yourselves true love and consonance (har-
 mony) as well as peace and freedom.
169) The teaching of the truth, the teaching of the spirit, the teaching of the life is given to you today as it was also
 given to all peoples before you, but like those before you also say that you indeed had no tidings of its expla-
 nation, but truly these tidings have been given to you therefore you only have to strive to understand it.
170) The truth-teaching is given to you as already to your forefathers and foremothers (ancestors/forebears), but like
 those before you, you do not want to have yourselves led (guided) better through it; however, the true prophets
 give you today a clear proof of the truth of the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vital -
 ities (Creation) through their teaching, so that you may finally understand it and follow the truth.
171) However, you are unfair and reject the signs (evidence) of the truth and turn yourselves away from it; but those
 amongst you who turn yourselves away from the signs (evidence), you will have a miserable existence and will
 serve yourselves with punishment in return because you will not find any true love or freedom or any peace or
 consonance (harmony) in yourselves.
172) Do not wait for liberators (angels) to come down from gods or tin gods to bring you help if you supplicate
 and wail to them, because they are without truth (forms invented by lies), which cannot give any signs (evi-
 dence).
173) And if signs (apparent evidence) happen which you demand through your belief (assumptions) in gods and tin
 gods, then the signs (apparent evidence) are only hallucinations (delusional constructions) that you form as pic-
 tures of deception (delusions of the brain) through the might of your inner world (consciousness); therefore
 your belief in gods and tin gods serves you no purpose, because as fabulated (invented) insubstantialities, they
 bring you neither disadvantage (loss/damage) nor advantage (benefit).
174) And truly, if you are split (not firm) in the truth, then you easily fall away from it and turn yourselves to a belief
 (assumptions), so you fall prey to godlinesses (religions) or sub-godlinesses (sects/cults) and no longer have any-
 thing to do with the real truth.
175) And if you are far from the truth and unfamiliar with it, then the untruth announces itself in you and you fall prey to everything that is unrightful, of unright, of unrighteousness (consciencelessness) and virtuelessness.
176) Therefore take heed that you turn to the truth and do good deeds, because these will be rewarded to you ten-
 fold; if, however, you perpetrate evil deeds then you will receive the same reward in evil and suffer under its
 unright.
177) See, the true prophets walk on the right and straight way which is given by the truth of the laws and recom-
 mendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), and truly, they are the upright ones who do not
 pray to any gods or tin gods or any people of your kind (human beings), and do not let themselves be subju-
 gated (placed in bondage).
178) The true prophets have no-one next to them to whom they bow or pray, instead they are surrounded by true
 friends, by man and woman and child, who recognise (see) their love and kindheartedness to all created cre -
 ations (life forms) and try to do the same as them, as they are the ones who follow the true prophets on the
 right and straight way and do not allow themselves to be led into confusion through the false teachings of false
 prophets, priests and all the servants of gods and servants of tin gods.
179) Truly, no other truth can be sought except for the real truth which is given through the laws and recommen-
 dations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation) and through its appearance (nature).
180) And no-one amongst you and no other created creation (life form) can act without the laws and recommen-
 dations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation); therefore none of you can act against or in favour of
 themselves or against or in favour of others because everything is directed (regulated) through the laws and
 recommendations so that a distinct condition (cause) brings about a distinct decision (effect = cause and
 effect).
181) And see, the true prophets instruct you in these things because you are disunited in yourselves and amongst
 one another, so that you may become knowing (conscious) and wise and that it may go well with you by you
 heeding and following the laws and recommendations of the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation).
182) And know that the true prophets are their own successors after their passing away (dying), always as new per-
 sonalities, who are above you in knowledge and in wisdom with regard to the laws and recommendations of
 the primal wellspring of all vitalities (Creation), but nevertheless they are modest and do not place themselves
 at higher levels above you, so they put themselves on an equal footing with you and do not demand any privi -
 leges over you, therefore they are people of your kind (human beings) in every wise in modesty and put them-
 selves on an equal level with you.
